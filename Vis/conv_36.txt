{'text': "I question the relevance of discussing Liataud and his taste for big game hunting in this article. While there is, evidently, at least one case where people have called for a boycott of the restaurant in response to Liataud's conduct, I don't think it's sufficiently relevant to the company itself to merit inclusion. Furthermore, even if it were relevant, I would argue that any mention would need to be fairly minimal to comply with WP:UNDUE. It's just not that significant an event in the overall history of the restaurant to merit the level of inclusion that has been sought. While controversy and criticism sections can be very helpful in balancing out an article—particularly in this case, where the article has pretty clearly been astroturfed in the past—the controversy and criticism discussed needs to be balanced in its relevance to the overall subject. —////", 'username': 'Mendaliv', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}

{'text': 'Ok, thanks for the tip Ian, I have thoroughly read the AGF article. I would love to discuss this controversy. The call for a boycott against Jimmy John\'s due to big game hunting practiced by the founder was widely covered by major news outlets including the Wall Street Journal. Although the calls for a boycott were initiated based on the actions of the founder, the implications of a boycott obviously extend to the company in general, thus making this an appropriate entry for the history section of this article. Wikipedia has indicated that this article is unbalanced because "A major contributor to this article appears to have a close connection with its subject." One step towards addressing and rectifying this imbalance would be to include a mention of the hunting controversy with a link to the Wall Street Journal article.Taquim', 'username': 'Taquim', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH4: Stating your stance'], 'coordination_labels': []}

Please remember that according to Wikipedia this article is currently unbalanced due to contributions from editors with close connections to the subject. It seems that a logical way to address this lack of balance would be to not shy away from including information that was very widely covered in the mainstream press.

{'text': 'Basically all the reasons have already been stated, so I am just re-iterating. First of all, there is WP:Coatrack, already mentioned by . The article is about Jimmy John’s, and not about the company’s founder. In addition, the call for a boycott was an isolated event of very few people, which quickly passed from the public consciousness, further making it irrelevant, which  pointed out.  In addition, since the issue was so minor, giving it more prominence in the Wikipedia article begins to violate WP:DUE, which strives to keep articles balanced to achieve WP:NPOV. Having an entire section dedicated to this issue tips the balance we are trying to achieve for this article, making it look like the boycott is important, widespread, and even relevant, which it is not, as stated already above. In order to keep this article balanced I believe the discussion of the boycott, should be kept out of the article.', 'username': '185.54.163.224', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'I\'d like to propose that we address the most serious issue regarding the Jimmy John\'s Wikipedia entry: according to the Wikipedia banner at the top of the article, the article needs cleanup because "A major contributor to this article appears to have a close connection with its subject." The banner indicates that this has resulted in problems with the balance and neutrality of the article. Why then, one might wonder would there be such fierce opposition to an entry in the article that attempts to address this imbalance as one step toward the removal of the Wikipedia warning banner? Claims of coatracking: Revelations of big game hunting by the founder and potential implications of a boycott were deemed by the Wall Street Journal and many other major news outlets to be worthy of coverage. This was a major news event, not a tangential one. Although it was the actions of the company owner that brought the media spotlight, as the Wall Street Journal pointed out, there were potential implications for the company in general. The IP address commenter above indicates concerns with Due and Undue Weight, but the Wikipedia entry defining that concept states that "Neutrality requires that each article or other page in the mainspace fairly represent all significant viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources..." which seems to indicate that the boycott should be mentioned and referenced to the Wall Street Journal and other articles. IP address commenter above states that "In order to keep this article balanced...."  However, this article currently has a Wikipedia banner at the top stating that the article is not balanced, meaning that "keeping" this article balanced would not be possible. I feel that this issue needs mediation but unfortunately Mendaliv has declined my invitation to mediation. Mendaliv has however (see above) suggested that a sentence referring to the boycott might be appropriate. I appreciate this gesture and I find this to be a reasonable compromise. Is anyone opposed to a one sentence mention of the boycott in the article with the Wall Street Journal article as citation? If there is not agreement, could we please take this to mediation rather than engage in editing wars?
