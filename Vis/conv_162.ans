[31mRobert McClenon: Third Opinion Request rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mRobert McClenon: A third opinion has been requested about the map.  Exactly what is the issue about the map?  I see that one editor supports the map and one editor dislikes the map, but it isn't clear what the issue is.  I would suggest re-reading the civility policy, and clarifying what the question is. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mAcidSnow: Well for starters, Somaliland is an autonomous region within Somalia. However, it's administration "desires" it's own independence from Somalia. Nonetheless, it's internationally recognized as an autonomous region within Somalia. Anyways, it's regional claims are disputed with that of Puntland and Awdalland. These regions are Sanaag and Sool, and Awdal respectively. Although they dispute these specific regions they recognize Somalilands claims to Woqooyi Galbeed and Togdheer. The map I created reflects exactly that. This is exactly what is done for various other places: South Ossetia, Transnistria, Abkhazia, etc. My design is very similar to that of the Autonomous communities of Spain, i.e Andalusia. More impotently, there was already a consensus established with three other users. These individuals being: CambridgeBayWeather (see here: ), Howicus (see here: ), and Rsrikanth05 (see here: ). Oddly enough, Dandaawi denies it's existence: "All i see is you against the world. i see no consnsus". rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mAcidSnow: What Dandaawi appears to desires is a map that doesn't include Somalia at all (despite Somaliland being a region within the nation). The map they also request doesn't even show the dispute with Awdalland. There might be other things that they desire as well, so you should ask them. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mDandaawi: The question is whats awdalland and where do they  control ?  Bring evidences that the So called  awdalland exists on the ground as an adminstration  challenging Somaliland rule in awdal. . The disputed area between Somaliland and puntland is already  marked on the above two  little maps. its also a well documented issue  as we can see here on bbc Somaliland profile [].   The reason i am against your map is is.
you marked  Awdal (western Somaliland] as disputed area.  Bring valid  evidence  that "awdalland" exits as an adminstration like Somaliland ? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mDandaawi: you fabricated the dispute area between Somaliland and puntland because you marked all Sool  and Sanaag as a disputed area although puntland claims the eastern parts of those regions ONLY   according to article 3 of puntland state constitution []
the map is different than any other Break away state map in wikipedia . Its close up image that shows only somalia regions. Somaliland location must be visible on the world map.
you used blue colors (Somalia flag color) to over shadow Somaliland existense.  Why cant we use that map right on top  if you dont have an agenda ? rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[36mSemanticMantis: Your points 3 and 4 seem at least somewhat valid. It should be no problem to change the shading to red or green or any other color. That being said, I think it's a stretch to say that the shading of the map implies pro-Somilia bias. Since it really doesn't matter, it shouldn't be a problem to change it either. I do think it would be best to show the situation within the continent. However, the maps above that show better context also make it hard to see the actual region in question. I'd suggest an inset be made for the newer map, similar to those above. The newer map is much easier to read, in my opinion. I can't comment on the first two points, that seems like more of an actual content dispute, whereas the others can be easily resolved. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mSemanticMantis: there are about 7 or more de facto/ break away states  in the world none of them have such a close up map showing the country they seceded from only , why Somaliland is different ? .  If puntland (the rival unionist federal state of somalia). Have that map (look right in the middle) why Somaliland cant have the top red one ?  Both maps shows the exact disputed area. Why do we need this new map ? user AcidSnow never explained any thing before he replaced the older map  He just did, like wiki is his own blog.  In addition to that he must prove that the Socalled Awdalland exists as an actual authority  against Somaliland rule over Awdal province. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mAcidSnow: Awdalland does exist as its own disputed territory. Although the state has done little work since 2009, it is nonetheless a disputed territory. More importantly, I didn't fabricate anything since Puntland claims on its own site that it claims all of Sanaag and Sool without giving any distinction, see here: . In fact, Puntland actually claims all of Sool in its own constitution as well, see here: . Nevertheless, I have updated the map to specific represent the constitution. I also added a map for the location of Somalia and Somaliland in as well. In addtion, I also plan to fix Puntlands map which is something I haven't gone around to. Anyways, kindly '''stop''' with the false accusations as they only speak negatively of you. As for the colors, I already explained this before that the specific color doesn't matter. In fact, the color Blue is none existent in the Spanish Flag but its nonetheless used in the Autonomous communities of Spain, i.e Andalusia. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mAcidSnow: ''Done'''. I have finally got around to fixing the maps of other regional states. These including Puntland, Jubbaland, and the South West State. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mDandaawi: Thanks for communicating ! I dont understand why you changed puntland map adding an other non practical dispute in nothern mudug region of puntland.  Its does not change the reality that there are only two functioning states in the north.Puntland and  Somaliland (federal vs defacto)  and one practically disputed area  between them. The rest of other disputed spots you marked in both states are unknown.  its crazy if we change every Somali diaspora or qabil  dream into reality.  Whats awdalland ? Where do they control ?  Are they state like puntland or  unionist Somalilanders in exile . Bring evidences. If we cant find any evidence please lets use the old puntland map you changed moment ago and the red Somaliland map that still appears over there. Also keep in mind that Somaliland is different than Puntland.Somaliland is seeking international recognition  so itS map should be similar to that of other break away defacto states. We can use  double  Maps close up and zoom out.  like these two examples .  BUT FIRST BRING EVIDENCE THAT AWDALLAND IS AN ACTUAL AUTHORITY AGAINST SOMALILAND RULE IN AWDAL. So we can solve the western portion  of the map you marked as disputed. Remember Exile unionist organizations  does not count when it comes territorial disputes. every state  have exile organisations  against their policy. Ethiopia  for example have dozens of diaspora anti TPLF ethincs and clans. I am not here to personally attack you or your country but i beleive informal reconciliation is more effective  than formal.

[34mDandaawi: ''Using the official  Somaliland Map only'''
'' Using the above (top) map showing the disputed eastern Sool and Sanaag regions   between Puntland and  Somaliland'''
''Two map solution'''  Plus you  should bring any reliable  evidences supporting your map that Awdalland exists  as a functioning state against Somaliland rule in western  Awdal region.
Can we agree any of the above? rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mAcidSnow: Sorry, but none of your ideas would work. See Awdalland for a start if your interested in learning about it. More importantly, cold you stop breaking consensus? Four users have already stated that they disagree with the map yet you continue to defy that and deny its existence? If not, then you risk being blocked. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[33mBuckshot06: I've been asked to comment by Dandaawi. The map that shows the disputed areas in a different colour is preferable to the block red (I think ex British Somaliland) map, and honestly, whatever one's views on the political status of Somaliland, it has been very closely associated with the 1960-91 Somalia for a very long time, so the "7" shaped map does offer greater recognition for those who are not Somalia experts. I am very tempted however to parcel out equal blocks for anyone who keeps edit warring on this page - sort it out here on the talkpage, that's what it's here for. Regards to all rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mAcidSnow: Thanks for understanding Buckshot06, I greatly appreciate it. There was already a solution made but he has nonetheless ignored it. If you didn't notice in the request he made for you, he doesn't seem to mind making personal attacks against users. It seem that he too will get away with this as well. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mDandaawi: Acid  i already suggested 'two map solution'  which means i have nothing  against the 7 shaped map if its showing the exact disputed area between Somaliland and puntland only. What you did is you  marked Awdal as a disputed area ,  take a look at the west/left  side of the mapthumb The question is , is it true that awdal is disputed?  What is awdalland and where do they control? If you cant prove then fix the map so we can use it As a second image.   User     If you compare Somaliland's BBC  Country profile   [] against  Acid's map you can see that he marked undisputed regions as disputed without bringing any evidence rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH5: Counterargument

[32mAcidSnow: Actually there is a strong consensus for the previous map. The present map also doesn't show the disputed area between Puntland and Somaliland but rather what is thought to be controlled by the two regions. It also incorrectly designates Somaliland as a separate nation when it is internationally recognized as an autonomous region within Somalia. This isn't how it is illustrated with other regions, such as: South Ossetia, Transnistria, Abkhazia, etc. As I previously shown, this map present it accordingly along with all the other issues: . rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH5: Counterargument
