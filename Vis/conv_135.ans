[31mMillenium187: This article should be about European state known as Czech Republic and Bohemia alone is not the Czech Republic. In the history section there is almost no mention of Moravia nor Silesia despite the fact that previous versions were much more objective. So the section is among other things clearly a '''violation of Wikipedia policy''' of neutral point of view. And I must also admit that I am really curios whether there are some strange motives involved, maybe even of political nature but maybe I am just too distrustful. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mIaroslavvs: Yes, you are too mistrustful. Nobody wants to conceal history of Moravia or Silesia from readers. These lands have their respective articles here. Quite comprehensive, I think. But Bohemia was historically the biggest, richest and most powerful, central Czech land - a seat of the rulers, "Head of the Crown". Main events of Czech history took place right here, in Bohemia. (Cf. relations of England vs. Britain, Holland vs. Netherlands, Croatia proper vs. Croatia, Moscovia vs. Russia, Lesser Poland vs. Poland, Lithuania proper vs. Lithuania etc. etc.) Other Czech lands (especially Moravia and Opavia/Upper Silesia) were in Europe perceived through Bohemian optics and farther from Bohemia, the less people were (and are) able to distinguish between domestic differences. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mIaroslavvs: If you want to add some another relevant informations about Moravia, Silesia or both Lusatias, go on! But don't scream your irritated allegations here. Thanks. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mMillenium187: Well, you surprised me a bit, really. I must admit that I expected much more tense ). Don't worry I won't scream my "irritated allegations" again (or at least until something make my blood boil again but that's I hope unlikely to happen ). I just wanted to state my opinion and that happened so I am satisfied. Thank you for polite and reasonable responses! But anyway, in my opinion the history section should still be expanded or generalized to "display more respect" to the Moravian history. I really think it should focus a little bit more on Moravia at least as a gesture of a good will and mutual respect between both nations (yes, there are two nations, officially). By the way I realize that what I wrote here might sound somewhat strange or something like that and I apologize if I offended anyone but you must understand that I am a Moravian patriot or at least I consider myself to be one. And many other people feel the same way so this (history of the Czech republic) is naturally a bit sensitive issue, not only for me but also for at least hundreds of thousands other people too. But as I said you don't need to worried about me I am usually a calm person and I won't raise such heavy accusations again unless I have really a very good reason, I promise. Is that ok with you? rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mVejvanƒçick√Ω: The article should provide relevant facts about the history of Moravia and Silesia, the regions are part of the Czech Republic, even though probably not "the biggest, richest and most powerful" ones )) Feel free to add the facts and don't forget to cite reliable sources. There's really no need to turn this debate into a battle of patriotic standpoints.   | rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mMillenium187: Thanks for your comment, it seems to me that the people here are more reasonable than I anticipated. I wrote this because I expected somewhat primitive behaviour as I know it from the Czech Wikipedia. Likely I will attempt to improve the article and extend the history section to include more relevant data concerning Moravia but fairly. And by the way Moravia once was the biggest, richest and most powerful and we cannot say it wasn't just because it isn't not now. Silesia lies in the Czech Republic only partially, it's a topic mainly related to Poland. Anyway I am still convinced that the history section still requires certain modification. Bye and thanks! rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mQertis: While I appreciate your Moravian patriotism, you seem to be missing the point here. "Bohemia" is a term with at least two slightly different meanings. Due to historical reasons, namely the fact that the country was part of the Habsburg monarchy for such a long time (especially during the era of nation-forming in the 19th century) and subsequently became part of Czechoslovakia, we tend to omit the broader meaning of the term Bohemia, which is the Czech/Bohemian state as a whole, including Moravia. In short, while Moravia has never been part of Bohemia proper, it is still part of Bohemia, now called Czech Republic in English. Its fairly common phenomenon in this part of the world actually. Styria is not part of Austria proper, yet it undoubtedly is part of Austria. The same goes for Poland and its regions/lands. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[35mCimmerian praetor: Interesting thought Millenium187. For Bohemians, Moravia is supposed to be in article about Moravia and should not be here, because it is simply far too east from Prague, which is anyway the only place worth mentioning in the Bohemian/Czech Republic. For Moravians (as it seems from what you have written), Silesia is anyway far too north, and if anything, it should be part of article about Poland, because anyway nobody in Moravia understands any of the dialects spoken by the 1 million people living in Czech Silesia. Talk about chauvinism.
And since you have introduced this line of argumentation, I would like to remind you, that Silesia was for 400 years the biggest part of the Czech Crown (yes I know, only small part of it remains with the current Czech Republic). rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mMillenium187: Ok, if Moravia really is a part of Bohemia then it will be very easy to prove it so may I ask you to do so please. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mMillenium187: Maybe you are right but a great part that "Silesians" still comes from Moravia and Bohemia due to the industrial revolution and the rapid growth of the cities there, not to mention that the major part of the current Czech Silesia is former Moravian territory. But I still respect the Czech Silesia I just said that it's not so important as Moravia, naturally as well as Moravia is now not so important part of the republic as Bohemia. And I think that you missing the point here, the crucial difference between Moravia and Silesia in the relation to the Czech Republic is that the entire Moravia is in CR but Silesia is mostly in Poland. What exactly are you trying to say, that I am a chauvinist or what? ) No offence, but if I am then I am obviously not the only one here, as you said: "For Bohemians, Moravia is supposed to be in article about Moravia and should not be here, because it is simply far too east from Prague". I agree and I take it as your confession. D rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mMillenium187: Oh yes, it was, I know, and the Great Moravia once was the most powerful empire in the Central Europe, and what does it mean now? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[35mCimmerian praetor: I don't know, you are the one who introduced this line of thought into the debate. rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mCimmerian praetor: There is actually larger proportion of people living in Silesia, who come from Poland and Slovakia/Upper Hungary, than from Moravia/Bohemia. rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[31mMillenium187: The point is whether you and the others "approve" addition of more data focused possibly solely on Moravia into the article or not. In another words do you honestly consider me to be a shallow minded person or a chauvinist when I merely want to put a bit more emphasis of the Moravian history? Even Bohemians used to consider the Margaviate to be a "feudum nobile" (a noble fee), Moravia used to a rich and proud land with a high level of autonomy, the great history of being once a powerful empire, a cradle of the Slavic culture and education, can you doubt it? Am I asking really so much? rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH4: Repeated argument
[36mQertis: So you are basically ignoring or denying the fact that Moravia was conquered by the Bohemian duke Oldrich in the early 11th century and has remained within the Bohemian state ever since. That's interesting but you are going to have a hard time finding a single reliable source supporting your point of view. rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[35mCimmerian praetor: I totally agree with you. I just found it amusing that you basically have the same line of thought regarding Silesia as Bohemians do when it comes to Moravia. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMillenium187: I am not ignoring it. I could also say that you are simply ignoring history of the Margraviate and history of the Empire. Maybe you we should say: "The Czech Republic, formerly known as Austria ...", for example Mendel wasn't Bohemia, he was Austrian. In my opinion maybe you are so focused on the Bohemian history that it blinds you a bit. Please define that "broader meaning of the term Bohemia" and delimit when and where it way used, excluding nationalism stunts from 19. century of course. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[36mQertis: Bohemian history I am so focused on is the history of the whole Czech/Bohemian state, not just its western portion without Moravia as you seem to imply. I have no special interest in any of the regions of the country be it in the west or east. You, on the other hand, are obviously keen on the history of Moravia, which is perfectly OK to me but it should not lead you to ignore the facts. And the fact is, again, that Moravia has been for centuries part of the state which was called Duchy of Bohemia, Kingdom of Bohemia, Crown of the Kingdom of Bohemia, ... and finally the Czech Republic. "Bohemia" is therefore the unique label which identifies the Czech statehood throughout centuries, just like "Poland", "Hungary" or "Austria" identify the respective statehoods of our neighbors. See  and many others. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mMillenium187: That's admirable that you are focused not only on Bohemia but also on the other lands of the state, and you are right I am focused almost only on Moravia but as you said there should be nothing wrong about it. Ignoring the facts, oh no, that's the last think I want to do, really. Please correct if I am wrong:
Moravia has been for centuries part of the state which was called Duchy of Bohemia, part of the Duchy, yes but only in years 1029-1182 (someone could also say to 1200) after that it was a direct fief of the Holy Roman Empire, not Bohemia, but often ruled by Bohemian Kings.
part of the Kingdom of Bohemia, I am convinced that it was never a part of the Kingdom of Bohemia, can you prove otherwise? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mMillenium187: part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Bohemia, I am not sure what you mean but if you mean "Lands of the Bohemian Crown" not the crown as a jewel itself then it was since the reign of Charles IV. who declared Moravia as a fief of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown by his authority of the Holy Roman Emperor, not the Bohemian King. That happened in 1348 but in year 1349 former Moravian Margrave the Charles renounced his rule in Moravia and gave it to his brother John Henry of Luxembourg and he ruled Moravia ever after until his death in 1375, then his son Jobs of Moravia inherited his title and so continued to rule in the Moravian Margaviate (but he never was the King of Bohemia!), in 1411 he was even elected the King of the Romans and so ruled in the entire empire and before that he was for example the Elector of Brandenburg (ruler of Brandenburg). But he died the same year he was elected the King, so then Bohemian Kings ruled in the Margaviate until 1419 (so in 1411-1419) and then again in 1458-1469 (In 1464 the King of Bohemia declared Moravian Magraviate as equal to the Bohemian Kingdom, in 1469-1490 Moravians rejected the Bohemian King and elected their own Matthias Corvinus) and again in 1490-1526 (but it was Jagiellon dynasty) and then since 1526 Moravia was, together with Bohemia but not as a part of Bohemia, one of the crownlands of the Hapsburg Empire (1526‚Äì1918) but 1608-1611 Matthias of Austria ruled the estate of Moravia so not the same man as the Bohemian King (because Moravia rejected the Bohemian King again), so Moravia had again a different ruler than Bohemia. Moravia had its own diet, law, courts, constitution, territory, army, etc. independent on Bohemia until 1749 (reign of Maria Theresia, Moravia and Bohemia de facto ceased to exist) and again but this time only partially since 1790 until 1918. Then in 1918 Moravia together with Bohemia, Slovakia, etc. formed the first Czechoslovakia but it remained a separate land from Bohemia, with its own capital city, president and so on (subdued to the Czechoslovakia, not Bohemia). And as far as I know Moravia had to accept the King of Bohemia as a ruler, he couldn't just rule without the land (Moravia) accepting him. (I am sorry I wrote this in haste.) So Moravia was a long time ago a part of the Terra Bohemiae but only in 1029-1182 as well as Bohemia once was part of the Moravian Empire. And Lands of the Bohemian Crown was a confederation. But I am not a histoprian, so please correct me if I am wrong. It doesn't have to be exact, just tell me when and why exactly was Moravia a part of Bohemia. I tried to find something supporting your thesis on the internet but I didn't find anything on the contrary I found sources which claim the same as do I, like  or  but they don't have to exactly accurate, they are just someone's websites. And a book with title "The Reformation 1520‚Äì1559" is also just a one book, but still can you write what exactly it says concerning this issue? ) And by the way that someone conquered Moravia a millennium ago doesn't mean so much, Moravia was conquered many times before and many times after as well as many other land in Europe. But I really don't want to turn this into a irrelevant discussion. I just wan you to provide a good prove that Moravia was a part of Bohemia and delimit when exactly, until that I am sorry but must refuse to accept this and you could also define precisely that "brother meaning" of the term Bohemia and also support it with a reliable source'''s''' and delimit when exactly it was valid. That's all I want, thank you! rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
