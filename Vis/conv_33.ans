[31mTraal: Parking shortage rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mTraal: The article states, "Lack of parking is a major problem in the Hillcrest area." But one could also truthfully state that underpriced parking rates are the problem, because a shortage occurs "when the price of an item is set below the equilibrium rate determined by supply and demand." rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mTraal: So then the question becomes, how is the difficulty of finding a convenient parking space a problem? Does it hurt the economy? Does it create traffic congestion? Does it inconvenience motorists? The article doesn't say. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mTraal: On the other hand, the economically optimal number of parking spaces is the number where the cost of building another one equals the revenue from building it. The article admits that the retailers could not justify the cost of a parking garage; therefore, MR rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMelanieN: So I gather you don't dispute that there is a parking shortage; you just dispute that the parking shortage is a problem. Am I understanding you correctly? If so, we could change the first sentence to read "there is a shortage of parking in the Hillcrest area," which I don't think anyone would dispute. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mTraal: Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are parking lots and garages in Hillcrest that always seem to have spaces available, so "shortage" may not be the right word. How about "visitors often have trouble finding parking in the Hillcrest area"? rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMelanieN: I think we need to go with what Reliable Sources say, rather than with our interpretation of anecdotal evidence or our analysis of the economics of parking spaces. My impression is that "parking shortage" is the common phrase in Reliable Source articles about the area. Let's evaluate that, shall we?  BTW thank you for calling my attention to this article; I've been neglecting it. It was seriously out of date with regard to the Uptown Partnership/Uptown Community Parking District; I have now updated it as well as improving the way some of the references were cited. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mMelanieN: OK, here is the relevant information from the three most relevant sources in the article. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMelanieN: The ''Uptown News'' article says "District Three Councilmember Todd Gloria recently said at a press conference one of the biggest complaints he gets from the community is about parking."
The UT "Partnership blasted over parking" article cites a "worsening parking situation," as well as the projected "shortage" numbers, which you disputed.
The UT "Parking in Hillcrest?" article says the area is "perpetually short of parking." rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mTraal: I don't doubt that Gloria would get a lot of complaints about parking. So maybe something like, "One of the biggest complaints voiced by the Hillcrest community is about parking." rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMelanieN: Let's back up. The article's current statement is "Lack of parking is a major problem in the Hillcrest area". That it is a problem seems to be pretty well supported by all the shouting and complaining about it, as well as the creation of quasi-governmental agencies tasked with creating more parking. But you tagged it as "dubious". I thought you were objecting to the word "problem", which could be considered POV. So I suggested "There is a shortage of parking in the HIllcrest area." That there is a shortage seems to be well supported by Reliable Sources, as cited above (two of the three sources actually used the word "short" or "shortage"). But now you seem to be objecting to the word "shortage", despite its repeated use by Reliable Sources. I don't understand why you are so determined to dance around the subject rather than making a simple statement of (what appears to be) fact. Is your objection that you don't think there is an actual shortage (based on an anecdotal comment by an anonymous person in a discussion thread on a blog where everyone else is saying that there IS a shortage), or that there is a shortage but it isn't a problem, or what? Let me understand what it is about this sentence that you are trying to fix. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mTraal: Because Uptown Partnership voted against building a parking garage, evidently they felt that there's no lack of parking or that it isn't enough of a problem to justify adding more parking. However, the complaints about parking show that parking is a concern, so "parking is a major concern in the Hillcrest area" would be a true statement supported by the cited sources. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mMelanieN: I guess I could go with that wording. I'll add it and delete the "dubious" tag. But just for the record, the Uptown Partnership felt no such thing. That interpretation is dead wrong. Their whole purpose in life, the reason the parking district was created, was to improve the parking situation (hence the name). After they realized they couldn't afford a parking garage, they turned their attention to trying to find additional on-street parking. And the reason the Uptown Partnership finally lost public favor and got dissolved was their failure to create more parking. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
