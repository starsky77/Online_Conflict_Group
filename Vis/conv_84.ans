[31mHerbxue: Inappropriate conclusion in lede of article rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mHerbxue: The end of the lede currently concludes that although TCM has some proponents, it is largely "irrational pseudoscience". This statement is problematic for several reasons.
1. The source for the statement is a 7 year old opinion piece. THe problem is not so much the age of the source, but the fact that one opinion is given the privilege of making the definitive value statement of the article (the last sentence of the lede).
2. The article should not be making a definitive value statement. The statement is certainly a notable and wide-spread OPINION, but it must be stated in the article WHO expressed this opinion. If not, it suggests that WP has collectively concluded that this opinion is fact. We have not.
3. Both words "irrational" and "pseudoscience" are intentionally pejorative terms - they do not add anything to the readers understanding of the issues involved, they are simply insults. If you want the reader to understand the lack of confirmation of TCM ideas by science, you can do so by simply citing the results of systematic reviews (which is what we have to do to justify a positive statement in WP med-related articles). If you don't do this, you are giving an opinion here, but presenting it as if it were fact. That is inappropriate. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mAlexbrn: Criticism needs to be included in the lede, and since TCM is fringe this needs to be made plain according to policy. ''Nature'' seems a fine source for such a claim, and age does not matter unless there's evidence TCM has lost its pseudoscience. Of recent interest here is Jimbo's statement on this subject: see Wikipedia:Lunatic charlatans.  || rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mHerbxue: I fully agree that criticism needs to be included, but an opinion piece in Nature does not constitute a fact that must be disproven (as you suggest), it is just an opinion. Your use of terms like fringe, pseudoscience, and lunatic charlatans shows that you are more interested in POV pushing than an honest appraisal of facts. You seem to take "Jimbo"'s POV to mean that WP policy is to push an anti-fringe POV - that is not what he said, he said some sources are reliable and others aren't. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[32mAlexbrn: Best to avoid ranting and personal attacks: you're pulling quite a few of the tactics outlined in WP:FLAT. TCM is ''obviously'' based on pseudoscience (meridians, anybody?) and that fringeiness needs to be abundantly clear in the lede according to our policy.  || rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH4: Repeated argument
[31mHerbxue: The only thing that's obvious is that using pejorative labels is controversial, as seen in the lengthy dialogue about use of the term pseudoscience in previous talk page conversations (of which I was not the main person arguing against using the term). So, to say its obvious the article should conclude with a value judgement about an entire medical system is nonsense. This is an encyclopedia, not "Consumer Reports". Show, don't tell. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mAlexbrn: Are you referring to the category discussion? Whether we use the pseudoscience ''category'' is a different question (on which I have no firm view). However, saying TCM is "largely irrational pseudoscience" (which the ''Nature'' piece says is "obvious") is fine - and not the least bit controversial, I'd have thought. Is there any serious dispute over the statement?  || rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mHerbxue: Yes, there is. Its fine to include as long as you clearly identify, in the body of the text, who is expressing that it is irrational pseudoscience. As it is written, it implies that WP editors have come to consensus that TCM is irrational pseudoscience. We have not, but even if we did it would be Original Research to express it in this way, thus a violation of guidelines. If the statement is changed to clearly assign ownership of that opinion / conclusion, then I have no problem with it. As it is, it is inappropriate. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH5: Counterargument
[32mAlexbrn: So that would be a WP:FLAT No 3? â€“ "You must not say 'the earth is not flat' but 'according to critics of the flat-earth theory, the earth is not flat'". Needlessly attributing uncontroversial statements risks creating the appearance of doubt or disagreement where there is none.  || rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mHerbxue: That's a dismissal on your part, not a sincere engagement with the issue. The "earth is not flat" is not equivalent here. MIllions of people consider TCM to be a valuable system of medicine, don't dismiss them unless you really know them (many are accomplished scientists). I assure you, the statement is controversial and disputable. You are smart enough to know that the article as written makes a conclusion that represents an opinion, and I have made clear that I am not interested in censoring out that opinion, only in making sure it is properly attributed. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation, DH4: Repeated argument
[32mAlexbrn: Ha! By swaying to popular misconception we'd be in trouble with our UFO, creationist, homeopathy, etc. articles too! TCM is essentially a medieval pre-scientific belief system that has no correspondence with real science. No serious source disputes that. It's just an obvious fact which we can, and should, assert. You have provided no sources for your argument, merely: assertions (that the statement is controversial), an argumentum ad populum and a personal attack.  || rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion, DH4: Repeated argument
[31mHerbxue: We could if we had consensus, and we don't. Simply agree to attribute the quote to its source and you would be doing the honorable and scientific thing to do. Instead you just make comparisons to other, more marginalized subjects. TCM may not be mainstream, but it is not "fringe" - there is licensure in many countries and universities dedicated to the subject in Asia and accredited colleges in the U.S. There are many convergences between TCM treatments and scientifically-verified actions of substances, so your dismissal that there is "no correspondence with real science" just shows your ignorance of the subject. If you do not understand the subject, how can you determine what an "obvious" judgement of its merits is? You cannot - you are only presenting an opinion. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation, DH4: Repeated argument
[34mJim1138: There are many sources stating that TCM is "pseudoscience". The question should be: "Why is there only one reference calling TCM pseudoscience?" Practitioners call TCM "science", yet the practitioners don't seem to perform scientific studies, so it passes the WP:DUCK test. I.e. pseudoscience. Given all of the points  has made here, the "honorable" and "scientific" thing to do here is to call it Fringe and Pseudoscience.  your behaviour here is bordering on a personal attack. Please focus on content. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH4: Stating your stance
[32mAlexbrn: The Joseph Needham source (currently in further reading) has some good content that can be used to expand the article explaining the disjunction between TCM and science. I hope to have time to get round to this shortly (unless somebody beats me to it!).  || rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mAlexbrn: I merely echo the mainstream, expert sources. Again, your arguments are of no use here. TCM is licensed in some countries ... so? Homeopathy is available from the National Health Service - that doesn't mean it's science. To repeat: "Needlessly attributing uncontroversial statements risks creating the appearance of doubt or disagreement where there is none". Show me the sources.  || rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mHerbxue: I respectfully disagree Jim. Practitioners generally do not call TCM science, and yet often do participate in scientific studies. I have personally conducted a pilot study on a topical herbal preparation, and have the highest respect for those that conduct serious research as a career. Alexbrn gets under my skin because he defended POV-pushing edits by Dominusvobisdu that misrepresented Ernst's conclusions regarding placebo effect, and thus has a history of preferring his opinion over facts. That should not cloud the real issue here - labeling a system of thought that is pre-scientific and that does not claim to be based on science "pseudoscience" is an expression of opinion, not fact. It may be a popular opinion, it may even be the MOST popular opinion, but that does not make it fact. An opinion should be attributed to those who express it in the body of an article. Alex, I fully welcome your contributions about the "disjunction between TCM and science", I have no problem with that line of thinking. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mAlexbrn: An appeal to personal experience and more personalization. If the statement is not in serious dispute (i.e. in high-quality sources) then it's a fact we can just assert. Failing to do so would not be neutral.  || rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mHerbxue: We've gotten circular at this point, need input from others. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mAlexbrn: Looks to me like there's no consensus for your proposed change.  || rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mHerbxue: Not yet at least. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mMallexikon: I don't feel comfortable with putting "pseudoscience" in the lede, for various reasons.
1.) I think TCM's theoretical base is largely superstitious, but "pseudoscience" implies that TCM actually tries to ''sound'' scientific. Which it doesn't. It has used the same terms since 2000 years.
2.) The source we have now is stating nothing else but the opinion of the author of the article, so the source could actually only be used for a sentence like: "An editorial in ''Nature'' stated that..."
3.) Apart from "pseudoscience", TCM has also been labeled "proto-science" and "pre-scientific" (and probably a couple of other terms as well that didn't show up on my google search). rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[36mMallexikon: My suggestion would be to either to not include all this labeling (and I actually don't understand the necessity for it) or to keep all these sources in a sentence like "TCM has been labeled pseudoscience, proto-science..." etc. rebuttal_labels:: 
[35m93.86.155.2: ''Comment''': calling TCL ''fringe'' is beyond ridiculous... Billion+ people in Asia turn to this instead of modern medicine. In fact, one could say modern medicine is fringe for Asians. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mMallexikon: Point taken. However, from a scientific worldview (and that's what we follow on WP), it would still be considered fringe. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mMallexikon: The source says "proto-scientific system". If you'd like to claim that that is not covered by WP:Close paraphrasing, I'll be happy to go into WP:DR about this. A third-party opinion might be a good starting point. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mHerbxue: Ok, well we have multiple editors agreeing that pseudoscience is not appropriate for the lede so I will abide by WP:CON and remove the whole sentence. rebuttal_labels:: 
[33m178.221.90.250: Not only pseudoscience label is inappropriate, but talking about TCM in context of fringe and similar guidelines is even more inappropriate. I don't think some editors here understand what fringe means. Even the cited guideline explains something different, read the nutshell if nothing further... rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mJim1138: This has been hashed out a number of times before. I would recommend reviewing the archives
Pseudoscience is appropriate. Besides the cite, it fits the wp:duck test. Many claim it to be scientific, yet fails to use scientific methodology. Many mechanisms of effect are not testable or fail testing. The Pseudoscience label should stay. Consensus has not been reached. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mHerbxue: Archives yield this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Traditional_Chinese_medicine/Archive_3#Pseudoscience
I would agree consensus has not been reached - either for or against use of the term pseudoscience, and certainly not for the article concluding it is pseudoscience in the lede. I propose a compromise - simply clearly show, in the text of the article, who asserts that it is pseudoscience. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
