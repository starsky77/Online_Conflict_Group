{'text': 'Second, "Work on this translation was prompted by the perceived trend towards looseness of style and content and theological liberalism in modern English Bible translations, such as the New International Version Inclusive Language Edition (NIVI) of 1996, which introduced large amounts of gender-neutral or "inclusive" language, which some found to be objectionable, and the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) which did the same..."....this seems contradict what the publisher of the ESV has stated, "The real origin of the ESV Bible goes back to the early 1990s, long before the gender-language controversy, when Crossway’s president, Dr. Lane T. Dennis, talked to a number of Christian scholars and pastors about the need for a new literal translation." (http://www.crossway.org/blog/2006/02/origin-of-the-esv/). And I did not even have to look hard for this.', 'username': 'Basileias', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
{'text': 'Point 2. The sources contradict, then. Maybe they were mulling it over in the early 1990s (in that case being prompted by the NRSV or NJB, which heralded the gender neutral debate), but everything else I\'ve read (secondary sources) say that it was a somewhat kneejerk reaction to the NIVI, or at least that\'s what prompted them to actually get it out (which is bolstered by Strauss and, oppositely, for the advertising rhetoric for the ESV as a "non-neutered" translation, much like the RSV-2CE, and, on the issue of time, for example, the Catholic NAB, prompted by \'\'Divino Afflante Spiritu\'\' 70 years ago, was completed in 1986, and just revised enough to achieve Vatican approval in 2011... Bibles take a long time without impetus), and that may be why, reading it, it comes across as slapshod in places (adjacent parts using different gender-language, due to an insufficient revision, I think) - but all of that is speculation or original research, so not in the article. If you feel the desire to rewrite the first two sentences of the "circumstances" paragraph to conform to that, I have no objection (although I do feel the ESV website may be less reliable in a sense than secondary sources, and more reliable in another, as those secondary sources are generally filled with more conjecture than a Wikipedia page so heavily tagged that it is unreadable).', 'username': 'JohnChrysostom', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
{'text': 'Point 1. Isaiah 7:14 is treated briefly (one or two sentences, I think), because it is a touchstone for this and similar translations, along with the other verses mentioned; such are often mentioned by defenders of the ESV (and NASB, KJV, NKJV, etc. as well), and the original "RSV Isaiah 7:14 controversy" lays directly behind this (as it\'s a revision of the RSV, to which this gives context - and sources). The ESV is a conservative and evangelical version; most things written on it are going to be by conservative evangelicals (and, surprisingly, some Catholic Bishops\' Conferences) just as one can find nothing written by them on the NRSV except for short dismissals, or endless debates over the neutered language. I added the sources about "almah as virgin" because I took it, in your original post, that you were disputing that in the article - not the very inclusion of it. Isaiah 7:14, Psalm 2, Genesis 1:1,3 are the OT touchstones and rallying cries of these Bibles ("Word of God in English", Bibliotheca Sacra), and Psalm 1 and Genesis 3:15 are the touchstones for the gender-neutral controversy (as all of the neutered ones use the incorrect "singular" they in those locations). These few verses are the main changes in the ESV (beyond the removal of archaic language and the moderate neutering) as compared to anything else in the RV-ASV-RSV-NRSV line, and the perceived improper rendering of these verses were what this translation was designed to rectify. \xa0', 'username': 'JohnChrysostom', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
{'text': 'I do not recall Crossway ever using advertising meaning "non-neutered" in their marketing. I understood the NIVI to only have been a UK release.

Take your time, Wikipedia is a WP:WORKINPROGRESS with WP:NODEADLINE. The NIVI was UK only, but it was planned for release in US but never got it because of the evangelical uproar; it was quietly ditched. Not until nine years later, when it was rebranded as "Today\'s New International Version", and, then, after accustomizing the public to it, trading the regular NIV for the NIVI in 2011. I don\'t know if you read the Bible, but the ESV, especially in the 2001 revision, and even now, has a once-over uneven feel in places - some were subjected to revision, vast tracts are the RSV. It feels rushed: objectionable parts were redacted and the sections around them revised, tracts with no objectionable material left untouched: at the borders of these divisions, one can see two completely different gender-language philosophies in chapter 26 and 27, for example (although I still think it to be one of the best Bibles available in an edition with the full 73-book canon in modern English; the NASB and NKJV have no full-canon edition, NETS, OSB, Knox, RSV-2CE, Old Jerusalem and Goodspeed would come close, DRC, CCD, Brenton and KJV [or TMB] for old [Early Modern] English). \xa0', 'username': 'JohnChrysostom', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
