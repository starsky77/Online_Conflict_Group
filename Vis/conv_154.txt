{'text': "I'd say my problems with this article is mainly with the delimitation and tone. If are going to have an article on mass organizations, then the text would need some serious re-working. The notion of 'fronts', with the conspirationalist (not sure that's a proper English word, but can't find a better at the moment, is tilted and highly paternalistic. It tries to assume that anyone associated with the communist movement would be duped by alien agents, it seeks to negate the possibility that people would embrace Marxism by their own free will. If we take an approach to communist mass work more globally (outside the scope of 1950s USA), we find that in most cases members and sympathizers of pro-communist mass organizations are: 1) well aware of the partisan links of the organization and 2) has sympathy towards the party organization.\nMass organizations should be understood in the following context: A Communist Party is, per definition, a vanguard party. To be a member of the party, you have to have a certain level of ideological formation and be willing to commit time and effort to party work. Many people, who might be sympathizers of the party, are not able/willing to assume this task. Thus the party creates mass organizations, usually along sectors (youth, students, trade unions, women, peasants, cultural associations, etc.), to which membership is open for anyone willing to join. The maximum programme of the mass organization coincides with minimum programme of the party.\nThat said, mass organizations are not a uniquely communist phenomenon. Could we find any source, that is not a Cold War diatribe, that actually explores this subject?

{'text': 'Mass organization redirects to "Communist party," which is epically dumb. "Communist front" and "Mass organization" are close to the same meaning, one being a right wing pejorative and the other a left wing self-description. There is a flavor of difference beyond that, an element of \'\'intended deception.\'\' Some CP mass organizations were comparatively open in terms of their association to the relevant Communist Party; others were not. Both terms should point to the same article, which will be a tough one to write with balance. It is absolutely beyond question, to my mind, that the article title should be "Mass organization" rather than "Communist front" on the basis of NPOV. The latter absolutely has a pejorative context, while the former is a self-description. This seems a pretty easy call. There\'s a comment above that "Communist front" is a term that is used in the literature. That\'s true. So is "Mass organization" (I was working from a book on the early CP of Vietnam this morning published in 1982 by Cornell University Press that used the term, for example). It will be a writing challenge getting things written neutrally, but there are battleground articles all over the place at WP and this doesn\'t seem like anywhere near the biggest.
