[32mJaakobou: [S]ome pro-Israeli media watchdog advocates is an incorrect presentation and is also a poor choice of words. You're selecting a sub-group of the far larger group people of those who use the term (e.g. Zionist neocon blogsphere, Elders of Zion, Palestinian Authority, Right wing Israelis, Settlers) and you need a source. That is simple Wikipedia guideline for controversial statements  and this is one of those. Catfish? '''' rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH5: Counterargument

[31mCJCurrie: This is what the source we're using for the lede actually says:
'But pro-Israel media-watchdog advocates have gone further, arguing that the footage is a prime example of what has been dubbed "Pallywood" - media manipulation, distortion and outright fraud by the Palestinians (and other Arabs, such as the Reuters photographer caught faking photos during the Second Lebanon War), designed to win the public relations war against Israel.''
Based on this (and other reasons that I've already mentioned), I think it's entirely appropriate for us to indicate that the term is used by pro-Israel media watchdog advocates. I've added the qualifier "some" because I don't think it's appropriate for us to indicate that ''all'' pro-Israel media watchdog advocates find this (racist) term appropriate. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mJaakobou: Sonia has made a clear improvement to the initial insertion. Thank you for your efforts! Still, the initial phrasing  "some pro-Israeli media watchdog advocates"  is still in there and is of poor choice even if we accept a special notability for this group, which I tend not to do. I'm not sure on how sources (i.e. not a single source) notate this issue. As such, I've decided to do the work I asked you to do for your change and have come up with these results in my first 3 sources...
Book by David Pratt (historian) - mentions only professor Richard Landes as the source.
Book by Cindy D. Ness (anthropologist) - does not outline a special group of users. Side note: I like her concise definition (per "phenomenon of manufacturing documentation about the conflict", "staged by local organizations to acquire sympathy and support from the outside world") better than the current quoted phrasing.
Book by Anna Geifman (historian) - uses the term on her own account.
After this short review I'm even more convinced that introduction of a certain group into the definition is incorrect. Moreso, when the current phrasing suggests the people behind the term represent watchdog organizations and are not free thinking individuals and proper researchers. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation

WP:MOSBEGIN for the concept of opening with a clear definition.

[32mJaakobou: p.s. I can see how the group of 'pro-Israeli media-watchdog' can be used further down, but sources do not support its disproportionate use in the definition. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mCJCurrie: Jaakobou, of the three sources you've identified, two simply make use of Richard Landes's work (Ness's book has a link to Landes's film), while the third is from a "terrorism expert" based in Israel whose doctoral thesis was supervised by Daniel Pipes. Beyond which, I don't think that looking for works that make passing reference to the term is the best way to find acceptable wording for the introduction. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mCJCurrie: Incidentally, you'll note that I haven't branded the term as racist in the article space. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mJaakobou: Whether we like it or not, all three are valid wiki-sources and were only presented to strengthen my belief that pointing out a single group in the definition itself is a poor choice that goes against policy. Best I am aware, the only notable person/origin/user for the term is  as was already presented in the article  Richard Landes. I'm open to a wider review of sources that support the alleged notability of the group you wish to insert in the definition but we can't define the term in accordance to your personal preference when there is no foundation to define it in this manner. I am not against mention of this group later down, but they cannot be singled out like this in the definition, even with the thoughtful rephrase attempt. If you want this to remain you must show some definition related notability through sources. This was my initial request to you and after doing a shallow source-hunting (first viable 3 sources I found) my initial perspective was only strenghtened that you were incorrect in this instance. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument

[31mCJCurrie: Jaakobou, this is Wikilawyering. There are only a limited number of credible sources that use this term ''at all''; the fact that you've found a few sources that use the term in passing does nothing to change the fact that it's been used primarily by pro-Israel media watchdogs (and some other pro-Israel commentators). For us to imply that the term has widespread usage is (i) incorrect and (ii) not supported by any sources. I suspect we'll have to take this to mediation, if you're not willing to accept any sort of compromise on this front.
Btw, my views about the nature of this term (I believe it to be racist) were applicable ''solely'' toward my decision to add the word "some" as a qualifer, which usage was consistent with both Wikipedia policy and basic common sense. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mCJCurrie: ''Addendum''' Here's what some published sources have said about term "Pallywood":
'France 2 has stuck by its story. But pro- Israeli commentators argue that this is finally independent proof of ``Pallywood'', the purported Palestinian-Hollywoodesque manufacture of news footage to further the cause, despite its fiction. We may never know the whole truth.'' (New Zealand Herald, 20 August 2008)
'Some Israelis and their supporters have suggested for years that video that might attract sympathy for Palestinians living under Israeli occupation is routinely staged and dismissed such scenes as "Pallywood" productions.'' (Robert Mackey, NYT Blogs, 5 August 2010)
'Since Hajj's work was discredited, the right-wing blogosphere has shifted into high gear, seeking out other potential instances of photo manipulation. Many are examining images from Qana, the site of an Israeli bombing last week where at least 28 civilians were killed. Others are digging into events in Gaza, claiming images from that Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been staged or edited for the cameras. Right-wing bloggers have dubbed that "Pallywood." '' (''Toronto Star'', 9 August 2006) rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mCJCurrie: Disputed wording the lede
Persons newly arrived at this discussion should note that there is currently a dispute as to the proper wording of the lede. I am prepared to accept the following wording:
''''Pallywood''', a portmanteau of "Palestinian" and "Hollywood", is a coinage that has been used by some pro-Israeli media watchdog advocates, among others, to describe alleged "media manipulation, distortion and outright fraud by the Palestinians and other Arabs ... designed to win the public relations war against Israel." The incidents of the Muhammad al-Durrah tapes and the 2006 Lebanon War photographs controversies (dubbed "Hizbollywood" or "Hezbollywood")'''ref name="tagesspiegel"''''Im Zweifel f√ºr den Zweifel,' ''Der Tagesspiegel'' 2006-08-09]'''/ref''' are notable events which have been cited as examples.'''ref name="jp071012"''''Caught in the Mohammad al-Dura crossfire, by Calev Ben-David, ''The Jerusalem Post'', October 12, 2007:: ''But pro-Israel media-watchdog advocates have gone further, arguing that the footage is a prime example of what has been dubbed "Pallywood" - media manipulation, distortion and outright fraud by the Palestinians (and other Arabs, such as the Reuters photographer caught faking photos during the Second Lebanon War), designed to win the public relations war against Israel.'''''/ref'''''
Others have proposed this wording:
''Pallywood''', a portmanteau of "Palestinian" and "Hollywood", is a coinage used to describe alleged cases of "media manipulation, distortion and outright fraud by the Palestinians and other Arabs ... designed to win the public relations war against Israel." The incidents of the Muhammad al-Durrah tapes and the 2006 Lebanon War photographs controversies (dubbed "Hizbollywood" or "Hezbollywood")'''ref name="tagesspiegel"''''Im Zweifel f√ºr den Zweifel,' ''Der Tagesspiegel'' 2006-08-09]'''/ref''' are notable events which have been cited as examples.'''ref name="jp071012"''''Caught in the Mohammad al-Dura crossfire, by Calev Ben-David, ''The Jerusalem Post'', October 12, 2007:: ''But pro-Israel media-watchdog advocates have gone further, arguing that the footage is a prime example of what has been dubbed "Pallywood" - media manipulation, distortion and outright fraud by the Palestinians (and other Arabs, such as the Reuters photographer caught faking photos during the Second Lebanon War), designed to win the public relations war against Israel.'''''/ref'''
I believe that the second wording is inappropriate in that it implies a greater currency for the term than actually exists. The term "Pallywood" is not widely used, and it is important for us to clarify within the lede that the term's usage is generally limited to a particular position within the Israel-Palestine dispute. Secondary sources (such as they exist) are clear on the term's framework. (I could add that passing references to the term within a few published studies are not sufficient evidence of wider usage.)
I believe that the term "Pallywood" is racist but I have not edited the article from this vantage point, except in that I added the word "some" before the phrase "pro-Israel media watchdog advocates" so as not to imply that all such advocates make use of the term. This action was not in any way inconsistent with Wikipedia policy.
I am open to compromise but I do not believe the second wording is at all acceptable. Comments and respectful dialogue are welcome. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mJaakobou: I can see your point about the second version suggesting it is of wide-usage when it is not. Give me a little while to think about a compromise suggestion. Considering your added sources, I'm conflicted on how to mention the groups which I see as most notable  i.e. pro-Israel advocates and media analysts. Another alternative, which is probably better  as I'm interested in maintaining the idea of a clear 'definition'  is to rephrase the usage part of the definition wich something such as 'which is sometimes used in the context of "manufactured news"'. I'm open to suggestions here but I do hope you understand why I believe focusing on "media-watchdog [organizations] advocates" in the definition is undue. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mJaakobou: p.s. let's drop the word racist from the discussion. You don't see me throwing around my personal beliefs about Palestinian media. The point, which is supported by policy, is to help promote positive dialogue. '''' rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
