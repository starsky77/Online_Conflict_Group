He has the right to legal counsel, to be advised in court of the charges brought against him, and of habeas corpus meant to force authorities to reveal where he's being held.  If he's been arrested by Spanish or Interpol or other authorities that's an entirely different story.  Are we to presume, for example, that he has the right to contest extradition?
