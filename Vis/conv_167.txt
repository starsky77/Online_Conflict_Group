{'text': 'Hello, I am a late comer in this discussion but I am somewhat literate in the subject. My impression is that the section "Origins of Earth system science" now accurately reflects the origin of ESS by acknowledging its foundations in the Gaia hypothesis. Where I see a hornet\'s nest with fuel to last is the section entitled "Relationship to Gaia theory". The POV, assessments and editorials shown there are simply not needed in Wikipedia; the statement has already been made in the section "Origins of Earth system science" that the Gaia theory was used for its foundation. The Gaia concept also evolved with time to conform 100% with the scientific terminology, so comparing them in parallel is a pissing match —evidenced in the talk page— not likely to stop any time soon. I strongly suggest to delete that section -while being aware of the hard work it took to reference those arguments.

It was then removed by Toby Tyrrell, of all people, with a note calling it irrelevant! Note above Prokaryote\'s talk about my recent edits adding back in material about the relationship with Gaia theory, as being "against consensus," which is pure rubbish. Indeed, it is because of folks like himself, who have rendered the obvious into something to be considered "controversial," that the entry demands a longer section to substantiate the facts in this "controversy." Keep in mind that if you look above you will note that Prokaryotes himself wrote that I should find citations from "academic textbooks" verifying the origins of ESS in Gaia theory, the importance of Gaia to ESS, etc, if I was to include this material. That\'s exactly what I did in the section "Relationship to Gaia theory," and now that I went through the work, and given that the material is obviously accurate and clearly pertinent, I have asked for protection of the article, and will keep asking for it if editors keep removing good work of another editor instead of adding their own material that expresses some "other side" of this "controversy", if they feel that there are some points missing that need to be in there.', 'username': 'Terradactyl', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH4: Stating your stance'], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}

To the extent that Gaia and ESS overlap or are even the same thing in essence today, it is extremely important to this article, if it is to have any intellectual honesty about it, that it discuss that fact, for reasons that remain obvious.

As mentioned, this material has been removed at least 6 times or so now, by a few aggressive editors, although I was not the first to include either a section on Gaia or the Amsterdam Declaration.

In my opinion, someone like Prokaryotes is essentially incompetetent: he seems to have little concern with what is actually in the article, he only cares about what ISN\'T in the article, and that has nothing to do with the Wiki philosophy. Prokaryotes has not only been blocked in the past, but he has also tried to evade his blocks with secondary accounts. This kind of aggressive destructive editing is a nuisance.

I see that there has been a long and frustrating edit war against user Toby Tyrrell who seemed inclined to \'supress\' Gaia theory altogether, so Terradactyl countered with his referenced arguments in the body of the article. The outcome is that that section was created and written in the style of a debate rather than an encyclopedic summary.

{'text': "If I can return to stick my oar in again. The original reverts by Toby Tyrrell (and, subsequently, myself) were to address an overemphasis on Gaia's ''current'' role in ESS. Gaia is of secondary importance in contemporary ESS research, and this is something I tried to illustrate above by looking on the Web of Science. That said, Gaia is certainly ''part'' of the history of ESS, and this should be represented here. However, it is also the case that much of contemporary ES modelling (the best example of systems science in a planetary context?) is borne out of extensions of long-standing weather and climate modelling that has gradually incorporated more and more aspects of the Earth system (e.g. the ocean, the terrestrial biota, marine biogeochemistry, the cryosphere, etc.). Gaia has, at best, only partially informed such work, and this is reflected in the relative lack of attention that Gaia receives in the scientific literature. It does still have its champions, and a number of them are prominent scientists, but it is not a hot mainstream topic, and its contribution to the history of ESS is not unequivocal. My issue here has been with Terradactyl's efforts to consistently overplay Gaia in ESS, not to expunge it.", 'username': 'Plumbago', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}

But he is wanting to keep out of the article the observation - made many times by others, including Lovelock himself, outside of the single citation I gave  -  that people do not talk about "Gaia" and use the term "ESS" instead simply to avoid the name "Gaia". That clearly changes things! And so the question here is, aside from dealing with the origins of the field, the actual contemporary relationship between ESS & Gaia, which, given the high profile of some of those who have said that they are identical, or nearly so, obviously is 100% required for any reasonably honest discussion about ESS!! Obviously, the reason that Tyrrell\'s expunging Gaia from this is not at all as Plumbago describes, and is tantamount to a crime within any reasonable world of scholarship, is that he makes money and a career and his reputation from the separation of these two things - as soon as one observes that these things, Gaia and ESS, are more or less identical, then his Gaia book isn\'t worth a dime!

Calling what is standard what is "neutral" in this case would be like considering "standard" discussion of Jews in Germany in the 30s "neutral": the bias is oozing out of all your pores. What Plumbago\'s trying to say in his rationale translates into this -  because the standard practice is bullshit, standard practice is what should be left as "neutral objective truth," and anyone trying to change this is biased. I am trying to be neutral, but describing Sally Hemings and Jefferson in a way that is "neutral" demands pissing off a lot of people, who of course are going to say that it is "biased" and "out of context", etc......\nI\'ve been fascinated with this Gaia/ESS relationship and done my research.

So, where\'s the Gaia? The one time I had lunch with Ken, he told me he had just gotten together with "Jim and Sandy" the week before, Lovelock was telling him this and that about what he was up to, etc. They are close, Ken\'s grad thesis was on CLAW and putting it together with the Hamilton equation, etc. So, like the rest of the story and your perverse logic, Gaia and Lovelock is totally fundamental to Ken\'s whole career and even his personal life, but is not discussed.

That way readers get an understanding of what these scientists think are important facts and concepts in understanding ESS. Agreeing with me so far? Good. As such, if a topic (like Gaia) gets short shrift in said scientific journals (and it does), that indicates that it is not a key central concept in ESS so should not dominate an article on ESS (which has been the nature of your edits since this kicked-off). Of course, the history of how ESS came to be what it is today is, naturally, also important, as are topics like Gaia which exist at the margins of active research, so they should appear in the article, but be contextualised as such.

I can well imagine that he is interested and engaged with Gaia (I don\'t know him at all well), but it would not appear to be so much that he writes lots of papers on the topic (or any). As it happens, his 1991 paper concludes ambivalently on Gaian feedbacks, although it makes the general case that "accidental" feedbacks like DMS (whose star has faded in recent years) might be expected to persist (a point I\'d heartily agree with).

I see it as essential to discuss the relationship between these things, with the full range of viewpoints on this interrelationship being discussed. The current version of mine in fact already covers a wide range of viewpoints  - from Sir Crispin Tickell, saying that they are basically synonymous, to those seeing them as distinct but still overlapping. Perhaps there are yet other ones I did not list that could be authoritatively cited, I don\'t know, but I have been asking all of you to include more. Multiple points of view are fine.\nBut the great irony here, with all this "NPOV" stuff, is that I do not even have a definite viewpoint on how best to characterize this interrelationship myself, and might say that, personally, it seems to me that in some contexts people are talking about the same things - as Ken Caldeira, etc, said, where the "underlying mechanisms are the same" - but in other cases they are not.\nWhat seems most clear to me is that Toby Tyrrell was utterly wrong when he wrote that Gaia was "irrelevent" to ESS, and removed material that had been in this article since 2011, not long after the article was begun by Andrew Lockley.
