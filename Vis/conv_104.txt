{'text': 'Another example of cherrypicking quotes from sources, and not presenting all sides of what is presented in the very sources used:Chávez has a Twitter account with more than 720,000 followers as of August 2010, with about 2000 joining every day. Carroll, Rory. "Hugo Chávez embraces Twitter to fight online \'conspiracy\'." guardian.co.uk 28 Apr 2010: n. pag. Web. 7 Aug 2010. . http://twitter.com/chavezcandanga Chávez\'s Twitter account has been described as a way for people to bypass bureaucracy and contact the president directly. There is a team of 200 people to sort through suggestions and comments sent via Twitter. Chávez has said Twitter is "another mechanism for contact with the public, to evaluate many things and to help many people."http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/10/hugo-chavez-twitter-venezuela  If so much space (in a grossly deficient article) is to be given to the Twitter account, then by all means, please present what the source says, for example, about the alleged team of 200 people, and his previous attacks on Twitter.  This is typical of the issues that occur in this article, resulting in unbalance and undue.  And why on earth spend so much time on Twitter, when so much else is lacking from the article, without establishing the context of his use of Twitter?  Didn\'t someone recently delete text about Chavez\'s speaking style, and yet this very source speaks to that ?  When using reliable sources, pls don\'t cherrypick from them to present one side only. Why does unbalanced text like this, which does not fully reflect what the sources say, stay in the article unchallenged, while anything else is endlessly nitpicked?', 'username': 'SandyGeorgia', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}

So if anything, using the internet to communicate makes him look reasonable. Nor do I think that everything was presented to "make him look good"  what made you feel this way? Please assume good faith on the part of editors  not everyone who doesn\'t include everything you would have included is some one-sided propagandist who is just out to "take things out of context" and "make Chavez look good". Maybe they were just trying to improve the article. But, anyhow, if you feel like it\'s worthy of inclusion, and as long as we stick to facts, I won\'t argue. But I do think it should be short, and I don\'t feel that editors should get to selectively remove anything that they feel is there to make him "look good", while "balancing it out" by replacing it with negative opinions from the corporate press. By the way, note how much space the White House has gotten discussing it\'s Facebook page, for instance (a single external link, which is about what I think this warrants) ... why is Chavez\'s twitter page so significant that it warrants a whole paragraph?', 'username': 'Jrtayloriv', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH3: Policing the discussion', 'DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
