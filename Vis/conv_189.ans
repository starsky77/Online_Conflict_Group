[31mThree-quarter-ten: From a linguistic science point of view, "thou" is a lexical item; it's a "real word" all right, although derived from a longer word by truncation. For those who oppose "thou" as a pagename, if you really started combing through etymologies of English-language words, I'd bet you could find many common words that came from such truncation that no longer have any registers where they "dare not tread". The idea that this process of linguistic evolution and expansion across registers must be stopped for propriety's sake bucks the realities of natural language. I agree that per WP:COMMONNAME, it's fine to keep the title as-is, and is actually preferable. A closer analogy would be if the article "physical examination" were called "physical exam". Physicians say "exam" or "lab" in speech much more often than they say "examination" or "laboratory"; and it's a certain hyperactive (although prevalent) kind of prescriptivism that insists that those words must never be written when the longer form could be substituted. The more common usage is not as horrid as a schoolmarm would have us believe. Her sense of how language works doesn't match linguistic reality. The comparison to "Dubya" is really a red herring. It speciously appeals as analogous on the surface, but it's a different subclass of the phenomenon (not least because names of persons are not precisely just like all other words in the way they're used and interchanged), and it serves as an exaggerated example that ends up being a straw man. Not saying that happens intentionallyâ€”just that the assumed equivalence is speciously appealing. â€”Â  rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mBadon: This article is an artifact of Wikipedia. It does not exist in the real world. Nobody writes "thou" (maybe you can find some irrelevant rare exceptions). Instead, it is always written numerically, or with the word "mil". Look to the plastic sheeting industry for examples. This article is an abomination and should be deleted, redirected, or renamed. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mBadon: I added dispute and citation needed templates. There are billions, if not trillions of works that use thousandths of an inch in the form of mils or just plain numbers. You could probably count on one hand the number of works that use the spelled-out literal verbal "thou". Nobody is ever going to be able to satisfactorily cite that "thou" is a unit, and "mil" is just another way of saying "thou". It's 100% total BS.
Mils and numerical forms have been used for as long as metrics capability has been able to reach that level of accuracy (probably since at least the 19th century). The most prominent usage of "thou" is only in this Wikipedia article. I dare you to try to find works using the word "thou" that predate this article. You get bonus points if you can find one that's older than Wikipedia. You don't even have to find cites to support the assertions of the article (they don't exist in significant numbers). rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mStepho-wrs: About 90 seconds on google brought my to Popular Science Oct 1963, page 220: http://books.google.com.au/books?id=niADAAAAMBAJ&pg;=PA220&q;=thou&f;=false#v=snippet&q;=thou&f;=false It took 90 seconds because I had to spend time to filter out Shakespearean thee, thy, thou. How do I claim my bonus? On the Australia car scene up to at least the 1980s, every mechanic would talk about overboring an engine by 30 thou, shaving 50 thou off the head or gaping the spark plugs by so many thou. Of course it's an abbreviation for thousands of an inch but it was used as a unit by practically every Australian mechanic and rev-head. Until I read it on Wikipedia, I had never even heard of 'mil'. Is 'mil' an official unit? To me it looks like another abbreviation of thousandth of an inch except it uses the romance root instead of the Germanic root. Which would make both 'thou' and 'mil' slang. Except that 'thou' is far more popular than 'mil' (at least in automotive circles). And 'mil' is going out of fashion because of confusion with millimeter. Â Â  rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mThree-quarter-ten: Badon, the mistake you're making is believing that Wikipedia only covers topics whose names are used in written registers. That's an assumption you're making, not an indisputable fact. Machinists *SAY* the word "thou" all day long, every day. That alone is why we are "allowed" to say it on Wikipedia. â€”Â  rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mThree-quarter-ten: By the way, nothing in this article, either now or before the recent edits, is or was incorrect. It's all correct. The overblown use of {cn} tags can stay, because yes it will be nice to take the time to find refs to cite, but your adding them with the tone that you think the information is wrong just exposes your own ignorance. If you were a machinist in a commercial machining environment in either the US or Australia or Britain, you wouldn't think this article is an "abomination" or whatever other silly hyperbolic adjective you might apply. This article exists in Wikipedia because it ACCURATELY covers the subject of what a thousandth of an inch is, and how machinists talk about it. So you're absolutely 100% wrong that "This article is an artifact of Wikipedia. It does not exist in the real world." Like I said above, just because the short form "thou" is seldom *written* doesn't have anything to do with the fact that machinists *say* it every day. â€”Â  rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Repeated argument
[36mUruiamme: Badon, the diverse ways which you are condemning this article smacks of trolling. As 3/4-10 points out, the article (faults and all) discusses the mil and thou in such a way as to make it clear that this is one of the many hundreds of units of measure that were developed before the ubiquity of the Metric system. If engineers in the 19th century '''DID NOT USE THE THOU''', then what in the world did they use? Do you propose that this article is mythology and should be deleted and yet at the same time you want it to move elsewhere? You find it so weird that "thou" and "mil" are equated when they seem like only semantic differences to those who use them? You know, some people find out new information on Wikipedia. Now that I attacked your methods, let me attack your sense of logic. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[36mUruiamme: Suppose that at least one person in the '''WORLD''' had a mnemonic or abbreviated way of pronouncing the following:
0.036 inch
Suppose that this person did not toe the line and say "36 thousandths of an inch" or "36 mil." Suppose he was unlearned, or his sense of abbreviation had gone wacko when he was dropped on his head when he was a child slaving inside a grimy engine factory in Detroit or in the Outback of Australia. And he alone said aloud, '''''36 THOU'''''. My question to you is this: Would his co-workers (a) laugh, (b) cry, (c) understand him and admonish him not to be linguistically lazy, (d) start using the same abbreviation. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mBadon: I am a machinist (and more). A darn good one too. I have done a bit of everything: medical, aerospace, tool and die, light industrial, heavy industrial, mining, oil, military, automotive, plastics, composites, ferrous, non-ferrous, metallic, non-metallic, hazardous, non-hazardous, robotic/CNC, manual, Japanese, American, German, Swiss, English, metric, modern, antique, chemical, biological, nuclear, etc, etc. Some of the things my teams have built are on Mars right now. Other bits are flitting around parts of the universe I can't even imagine. But, none of that is important.
What is important is "thou" is not the name for the unit of length equal to .001 inch. It is a verbal abbreviation for the word "thousandth", and NOTHING MORE. Yes, everyone in industry who uses any thousandth of any unit will say the word "thou" as a matter of expediency. Yes, we say "thou" even when talking about .001 millimeters. Things like that are the reason the Mars Climate Orbiter crashed. For inches, the unit name is "Mil". Anything else is supplementary to that, not vice-versa.
I have seen ungodly quantities of blueprints and technical documents, in more languages than I can identify. Not one of them has the word "thou" on it. Many of them have the word "mil", though. That includes blueprints originating from Europe, China, or some other part of the world. In total, I will make a wild guess that there are at least 1 trillion written works that do NOT use the word "thou". The word "thou" is specious, and it's non-verbal usage is also specious. If it deserves an article, then it is on the same level as ain't. I don't think "thou" deserves its own article, but I see nothing wrong with making one.
What I am opposed to is supplanting formal "Mil" with informal "thou". It makes no sense. It would be equally stupid in any culture, and any language. You don't push aside technical specificity for vague colloquialisms. Somebody tried that once with something important, and it's now twisted up in it's own little crater on Mars. Maybe you should call that guy up ask him how his career is doing, to get an idea of how ridiculous such things are.
Mil is the correct name for the unit of length equal to .001 inch. "thou" is a verbal slang abbreviation for the word "thousand(th)(s)". That's all there is to it. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mStepho-wrs: I will make a wild guess that there are at least 1 trillion written works that do NOT use the word "NASA". Is there a point?
As for confusing "thou" for thousandth of a millimetre, I'd say that confusing confusing "mil" with millimetre is far more likely in this era of metric use. But that's off topic - we live with what the real world throws at us. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mStepho-wrs: Please provide a reference for the formal definition of 'mil'. Otherwise we have to put ''both'' "mil" and "thou" on an informal footing. If you can give a formal reference then the discussion is over and we can go back to being productive. Â Â  rebuttal_labels::

[32mBadon: And yes, there is a point (you completely missed it). 1 trillion written works where the subject is measurements in mil units is pretty conspicuous if not one of them uses the word "thou". It doesn't get any more definitive than that. Seriously, how could it be more definitive? If out of 1 trillion definitive works you can find maybe 20 questionably notable ones that say "thou", what kind of insanity does it take to decide the 20 is more important than the trillion?

[36mUruiamme: ''Ok, Badon, Me TOO!''' I think that if it was up to me, the article would be titled "Mil" or "Mil (unit)" or something and the article would use the ''mil'' for most of its language. I don't see anything horribly wrong with keeping it the way it is, but I would prefer that mil predominate. Now, what about you? Could you tolerate some or very many ''thou''s in the article? Obviously your threshold for pain was quite low on this one, so please elaborate. I am afraid some folks from UKoGBaNI and the Commonwealth states might have a '''low tolerance''' (pun intended) for instances of the ''mil''. I think in the overall scheme of things that the ''thou'' is too heavily used for my tastes, but it hasn't aggrieved me. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mStepho-wrs: Badon.
Yes, I saw your point but its hard to take it seriously when you go off into hyperbole and wild exaggeration. These supposed 1 trillion written works prove very little. I could find plenty of works that mention "thou" and do not mention "mil". Advantage neither side. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[34mStepho-wrs: As mentioned in the article, some fields of work naturally use "mil" (the article mentions thin plastics, a field in which I am not familiar) and other fields naturally use "thou" (eg automotive, of which I am quite familiar). Advantage neither side.
You anecdotally mentioned that you have seen many works with "mil" and none in "thou". I counted this with my own anecdote of many works with "thou" and none in "mil". Advantage neither side.
Uruiamme might have something in it being an American vs Commonwealth thing (I'm Australian but have worked in many countries). If it is an American vs Commonwealth thing then WP:ENGVAR says that both forms are valid but that we should not change the title unless there is clear consensus.  See Talk:Aluminium/Spelling and the history of Aluminium if you want to see a full fledged war based on cultural usage. Advantage neither side.
Your google search doesn't produce much that usable. I checked the first few pages and they were mostly sites like www.answer.com - not exactly first class references. I'm not going to do your work for you by wading through thousands of links. However, your search did produce http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mil but that's an American dictionary and I'm not sure whether a dictionary counts as an official definition. If dictionaries count then http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/thou makes the same claim for "thou". Here's the correspond google search for "thou" https://www.google.com/search?q=thou+definition+inch which produces sites with a similar lack of quality as your search. You still haven't provided an ''official'' body that defines "mil" as an official unit. Advantage neither side.
So far it looks like two informal units used in different fields and possibly different cultures. Â Â  rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mBadon: I have run out of time for addressing all of your points, some of which I disagree with still. The one thing I partly agree with is the largely informal nature of both "mil" and "thou". However, the definition for "mil" is unambiguous, while "thou" is just slang for "thousand(th)(s)". There's a reason we don't call the kilogram a "kilo".
Kilo is in far more common usage in verbal language than "kilogram", but it is just ambiguous slang, and not suitable for being presented as anything else. "Kg" is also just an abbreviation, and not suitable for an article title even though it is both standardized, and in far more common usage in written works than either "kilogram" or "kilo". "Kg" and "kilo" both take second place to the unambiguous "kilogram", simply because they're merely alternative forms for "kilogram". rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mBadon: Another proposal is to rename the article to "Thousandth of an inch". Then we can discuss "mil" and "thou" on equal footing, and I don't think there's any disagreement about that. What do you think? rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mStepho-wrs: Good, we at least agree that both forms are informal. I'm still confused about a couple of your points. If 'thou' is dismissed as just an abbreviation of thousandth then why is 'mil' okay when it is just an abbreviation of 'mille' (Latin for thousandth)? And if 'thou' is dismissed because of potential confusion between thousandths of an inch and thousandths of some other unit then why is 'mil' okay when it can be confused with mm (common in metric countries to say 5 mm as '5 mil')? rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mStepho-wrs: The article concerns the expression used. People tend to type in the expression rather than the formal concept. My preferences for the article name would be 'Thou' (first), 'Mil' (second), 'Thousandth of an inch' (very distant third). Â Â  rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mBadon: Redirects can handle whatever people are likely to type in. I concede that "mil" and "thou" are on equal footing beneath "Thousandth of an inch", for the purposes of this article. If we are moving towards Thousandth of an inch as the proper title for this article, then we can present the full spectrum of usage of numerical forms, "mil", "thou", and whatever else is notable, all within an unambiguous context of "Thousandth of an inch". rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mBadon: I disagree that the article concerns solely the expression "thou". Firstly, given its nature as a trivial abbreviation of the word "thousand(th)(s)", it is either ambiguously meaningless or not sufficiently notable for Wikipedia, separately from the full context of "Thousandth of an inch". "Mil" seems to be in a similar situation. Therefore, information about the unit of length meaning for both "mil" and "thou" naturally belongs in an article about "Thousandth of an inch". I learned a few things just fleshing this issue out here on the talk page - like "mil" is not so well-defined as I had thought, which makes it perhaps literally equivalent to "thou" as yet another informal abbreviation of an ambiguous word (although the choice of a Latin word was undoubtedly meant to avoid ambiguity and trivialness, much like Latin and Greek scientific naming schemes - a feature that "thou" does not have). rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mBadon: So, in terms of raw usefulness, I think a properly contextualized article explaining all of this would be very good for anyone looking for the information. I'm a pretty knowledgeable fellow, particularly in this area of specialty, so the fact that I didn't know some of this information is a testament to the importance of getting this article right here on Wikipedia. rebuttal_labels::

[34mStepho-wrs: I much prefer 'thou' due to my own biases and could live with 'mil' in recognition of other people's biases (as agreed by both of us, both forms are on an equal footing).

[32mBadon: Sounds good, I'll kick back and visit this talk page again in a few days. Wost Wikipedians are lifelong-learners, so I'm sure we'll recover after we integrate this "new" paradigm into our subconscious ) If it's any consolation, America will probably switch to the metric system after we finally figure out exactly what to call this unit we've been using for the last 200 years, and then it will be just a historical curiosity... rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mBadon: It has been a over a month since there has been any discussion of disagreement about renaming this article to Thousandth of an inch. This is a last call for further discussion, and if there's no response or no disagreement, then myself or someone else can do the move and adjust the phrasing in the article to accommodate it. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mStepho-wrs: Oops, I'd forgotten about this. I'm still not thrilled about the proposed name but I'll not stand in it's way. Don't forget to make 'thou' and 'mil' redirect to the new name and to mention them both prominently in the introduction. Â Â  rebuttal_labels::
