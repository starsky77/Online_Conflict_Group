[31mAbsolutelypuremilk: Blog posts from Open Democracy rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mAbsolutelypuremilk: I removed content supported by blog posts on Open Democracy and London Review of Books. These do not seem like useful additions to the article. They don't seem to be adhering to NPOV. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mSionk: They are both reliable journalistic sources with an editorial team. LRB is also a printed bi-monthly magazine. Maybe you don't like their opinions, but neither are used extensively here (in contrast to some other partisan publications). rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mSlatersteven: Blogs are generally not RS unless by noted experts or as the opinion of the subject of the article. Which of these do they meet? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mSionk: Not sure where you got that bit of guidance from. Reliable sources are ones with a reputation for fact checking etc. If a reliable source (e.g. newspaper, magazine) publishes pieces in blog form, that doesn't make them automatically unreliable. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mSlatersteven: True, but they have to (under those circumstances) actually be by professional journalists or are by experts in the field, ad are subject to normal editorial control. Just being hosted by a news organ is not enough. SO are they? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mSionk: You seem to be making this up as you go along. I've given my opinion to the OP, the removal of the content has been reverted anyway. It added a welcome, pertinent and brief response to the largely one-sided description of events. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Stating your stance
[34mSlatersteven: WP:UGC "Some news outlets host interactive columns they call "blogs", and these may be acceptable as sources if the writers are professional journalists or professionals in the field on which they write, and the blog is subject to the news outlet's full editorial control. Posts left by readers may never be used as sources ". rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[36mTanbircdq: I'm not aware of either publication being blogs, they're both reliable sources. They're probably not useful if the intention is to present a one-sided POV of the article, however, in order to provide balance they will be. I'm not sure how either aren't NPOV either, both have a wide range of contributors, I can't see this being any different to the left-wing ''New Statesman'', the liberal ''The Guardian'', and conservative ''The Daily Telegraph'' or ''The Spectator'' etc. RS relates to sources and POV/NPOV relates to the content anyway.
As far as I'm aware both publications are subject to editorial control. The writers who have been used here are an independent researcher, an Israeli historian and a former appeal court and ECJ judge. The content from these sources have been published in secondary sources too which have now been added to the article. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
