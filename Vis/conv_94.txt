{'text': 'Whether or not I am "well informed" about HA Schult is irrelevant, and you aren\'t doing yourself any favors by repeatedly making this accusation and suggesting that the problem here is my ignorance of this barely notable German garbage artist\'s contributions to society rather than your noncompliance with WP:RS and WP:VER. The DW article in question listed Shult\'s name underlined at the top, so it\'s easy to mistake him as the author. Nonetheless, when a source says something vague along the lines of "art critics say he is a modern day (whatever)", it carries little weight unless the critics are named (as per WP:REDFLAG). More importantly, you previously challenged me to consult "the many press releases and articles cited" about Schult, but this is clearly a fools errand because the source that was cited most often (6 out of the 12 citations) is an obscure out of print 1978 publication in German (i.e., \'\'HA Schult der Macher\'\') for which you provided no link that would enable verification. This raises an issue at to whether the artist is even notable enough to warrant a WP entry in English Wikipedia.', 'username': 'Rhode Island Red', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH3: Policing the discussion', 'DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'I\'ve looked at a few more sources and I think I the argument for notability is fairly sound. That aside, I think the main issue here is that the article relies too heavily on that one old obscure source in German (\'\'HA Schult der Macher\'\'). The article would be better if it relied less on this one source (it accounts for 6 of the 12 references cited) and included more content from reliable English sources, like ArtNews, and and these which aren\'t cited yet. I also noticed that ArtNews said that his work had been "compared" to that of Christo, which IMO is a better source and a better quote (more neutral) than the slightly more exaggerated one saying that he "has been called the \'German Christo\' for the epic scale of his work", although, really, an argument could be made for the latter as well. You know, you\'re not really far away from having a good article about Schult, and I\'ll be happy to work with you going forward to bring it up to the highest caliber.', 'username': 'Rhode Island Red', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH4: Repeated argument'], 'coordination_labels': ['Conceding / recanting', 'Coordinating edits']}
{'text': "And BTW, if you are the artist himself, or a second party writing on his behalf, that's OK too. If that's the case, it might be worth reading WP:COI, but having a COI doesn't necessarily preclude you from contributing (although in some situations it's at least frowned upon) or require that you reveal your identity (although such transparency is encouraged in the case of a COI). If you need input, I'll be happy to help out. I actually think some of the artist's works/happenings are pretty interesting...especially the plane crash into the NY garbage dump.

{'text': 'Be that as it may, it\'s an obscure, very old, and out of print source, so it can\'t be readily verified  it\'s not ideal IMO; it would be much better to find secondary sources in English that quote the original source.

Are you saying that he is a subject of academic interest and academic articles are citing this older work?
