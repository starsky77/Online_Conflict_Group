{'text': 'Keith, I was following the WP Be Bold suggestion, which seems to me to say that "asking" first is neither required, nor even desired. As to faith in readers\' literacy, surely you\'d agree there\'s a sensible level of material that is suitable for any given publication? As to opinion, I mentioned that the Google search incidence of the phrase "anglophone monoglots" is barely over 500. In other words, it is *astoundingly* rare. I, a native English speaker, had to follow the links to find out what you meant. I suggest that forcing a reader to use links for meaning is less than ideal, particularly where a far more accessible option  "English-speakers"  is perfectly sufficient.

{'text': ', your edit was fine. You\'re at least the third person to attempt to clear up this silliness. However, Keith-264\'s repeated rapid reverts on this point, demonstrate that we have an "owner" problem with this Article. (Perhaps we need a move request, to rename the article "Keith\'s Battle of the Somme Article"). But in fact there is an even more important point at stake here, but also one that has been pointed out before and rejected by Keith The Owner; namely that the article\'s introduction is simply too long and detailed. And certainly that contentious paragraph is utterly out of place \'\'\'in the introduction\'\'\'. Keith The Owner may know something about WW1, but he clearly has a lot to learn about what it takes to be an encyclopedist. Compare this article with, for example, Britannica\'s article.  The information WP carries may be fine (albeit the prose is, as you say, not great) but the problem is that it seems only Keith The Owner\'s opinions carry weight here. I\'ve udone Keith-264\'s reversion since he is now reverting several people on the same point. And, as per discussion with another poster further down this page, and in line with other encyclopedia formats, I\'ve moved the "criticism" paragraphs out of the lead of the article and into a specific "Criticisms" subsection.

I\'m not fussed either way, but I\'d defer to history experts  i.e. those who know what the heck "Historiography" actually means in practical use  on the matter.
