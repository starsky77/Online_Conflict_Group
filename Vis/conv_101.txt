Explaining the nature of the allegations, how it played out in court, and ''why'' the allegations were rejected by the supreme court is important to help those people understand the nature of these things. Without that section, people will continue to believe that there actually is credible evidence. Those allegations are an integral part of this case and its important for the audience to understand how this all played out and the prosecutorial misconduct that went into it.", 'username': 'Bali88', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
{'text': 'You can\'t just omit any reference to the molestation allegations. I did no such thing in my edit. The allegation that Carr had molested his 5 year old daughter was mentioned thrice in my edit. As you can see here, it\'s in the lede (mentioned in the full proper context of the  second conviction being overturned because the prosecution told the jury Carr molested his daughter Jill  their opening statement but brought forward no evidence to support their accusation. Then the molestation is mentioned in the second trial section, and finally in the prosecutorial misconduct section.\nCurrently there is a Molestation allegations section that  begins \'\'\'"The molestation allegations remain controversial and there is little consensus as to the cause of Jill\'s injuries"\'\'\' and ends \'\'\'"The nature and the cause of Jill\'s injuries remain a mystery, as well does the time frame in which they happened.

Even if he was not a living person, WP:ALIVE, that phasing is weight and not NPOV.

I have already given my reasons and supplied quotes in bold of the beginning and end of the section, which I think is showing an unacceptable tone and content throughout, especially for a allegation of this type about a living person. You saying  "There was nothing linking it to Camm, but the supreme court didn\'t rule that it wasn\'t a sexual assault"  is an odd way to look at it and not in line with my understanding of BLP policy.
