There are reliable sources that state that the Holy See does have a coat of arms and indicate what it is.  No reliable source states that the Holy See has no coat of arms.\nAn editor has claimed: "Papal emblems such as the three-tiered cross, keys, tiara and umbraculum are known to have even earlier origins dating to the late thirteenth century."  That requires citation of a reliable source.  The "three-tiered cross" is considered by some sources to be relative modern.

Examples show that the arms of both entities were drawn without concern for the placement of the gold and silver keys.\n(4) The Heraldry Society actually states the arms, drawn by Archbishop Heim nonetheless, of the Papacy and of the Vatican State are with the gold key in bend and the silver in bend sinister, when this article states the silver is in bend and the gold in bend sinister. See here.\n(5) Galbreath is a good source, and his book states that the keys are both silver, then found gold, then found gold and silver with examples of the gold key in bend or in bend sinister. He gives evidence that the keys have a long history of being fluid in their depictions.\n(6) The Vatican has only issued information about the Holy See having an emblem currently, see here.\n(7) The Vatican hasn't issued any information of late that would suggest the Holy See still uses a coat of arms. When I say ''seems'', I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that the Holy See still has arms and haven't removed that information.\n(8) You can not seem to find a contemporary source that says the Holy See still has arms, and rely on information published as far back as a century ago.\n(9) You constantly ignore the most recent publication issued by the Vatican itself  from September of 2013.

{'text': 'Your idea that the Flags of the World site was a forum or wiki was once mine, but I was proved wrong.  See the archives and read what Palnatoke said on 10 August 2012, showing that it is reckoned a reliable source for Wikipedia.  And it isn\'t the only source. The essential thing is that there is no source whatever that says the Holy See has no coat of arms, and there are many that say there is such a thing.\nThis article is about the coat of arms of the Holy See, not about the symbol/emblem that, every agrees, it (also) has.  The documentation of the Holy See Press Office on the official website of the Holy See gives an emblem of the Holy See, but, in spite of your insistence to the contrary, \'\'it does not say the Holy See has no coat of arms\'\'.\nPerhaps an example will make this even more clear.  The harp, as an emblem of Ireland, is on the reverse of Irish coins, both euro and pre-euro (see images here).  In various colours the emblem appears on government documents and letters and on Irish passports.  None of these deny that there is a coat of arms of Ireland.  There \'\'is\'\' a coat of arms of Ireland, blazoned \'\'azure a harp or, stringed argent\'\'.\nSo you still have found not even one single reliable source that denies the existence of a coat of arms of the Holy See.\nAnd why have you deleted information based on reliable sources?  What could be more reliable for the coat of arms of arms of Vatican City State than the picture of it in its Fundamental Law?  So why did you delete the information about that?  Why did you delete the information on the crossed keys and tiara appearing as a coat of arms in the 14th century?  Why did you ignore here on the talk page Galbreath\'s statement that the position of the gold key in bend and the silver one in bend sinister became established and practically made him say the opposite?  Goodall says the same, but you present him practically as saying the opposite: don\'t you understand that "the practice of placing a gold key in bend over another in bend sinister of silver is not found with any certainty before the time of Pius II (1458-64)" means that this had become the practice by, at latest, 1460 or thereabouts, five and a half centuries ago?', 'username': 'Esoglou', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation', 'DH4: Repeated argument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
