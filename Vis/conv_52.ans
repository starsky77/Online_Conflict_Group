[31mJossi: What happened to the well sourced, balanced and NPOV section that was called "Reception"? rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mQuackGuru: Reception is a vague title and a lot of that information was not NPOV. Having a huge section is very silly and makes it difficult to read. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mJossi: Reception as a section is widely used, and "i don't like it", or it is "silly" is not an argument. As for the sources, which one was not NPOV? I am restoring that section and look forward to ''specific'' concerns to be raised. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mJossi: A "Reception" section that does not segregates ''pro'' and ''con'' viewpoints, and that rather presents all significant opinions on this site is the best way to reach NPOV. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mElonka: In terms of restoring sections, please be sure to acquaint yourself with the new #Conditions for editing on the article, especially that it is now under 0RR (no revert) restrictions. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mJossi: I missed that, thanks. But note that I simply restored the "Reception" section. Is that a revert?  Or is it that this is a ''status quo'' page that one cannot edit? Please clarify. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mElonka: It's borderline, leaning towards revert.  On the one hand, the information wasn't put in with a simple use of the "undo" or "rollback" buttons.  However, the information re-added was clearly a word for word restoral of a section from a few days ago, and when it was re-added, it removed some  tags, but without adequately addressing the concerns. Since the conditions are fairly new, we can write it off as "the editor didn't know", but if such a thing happened again, then it would be regarded as a violation of restrictions. In the future, a better way to handle it would be to move more slowly, adding a few sentences at a time, and trying to find a compromise version, without just doing a copy/paste restoral. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mVsmith: I've just reverted Jossi's ''massive revert''. Making such a revert as he did as an involved editor and saying ''I missed that'' and immediately going on wikibreak just won't work.
For Elonka to say ''it's borderline'' because "undue" or "rollback" weren't used is absurd. I didn't use those buttons so therefore I didn't revert by that ''reasoning''. If this editing restriction imposed by Elonka is to work, it must be applied to all involved editors and not waffle and allow an involved admin (Jossi) to violate the terms. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mElonka: Jossi had made no edits to the article since the restrictions were put in place, and it was reasonable to assume that Jossi did not know about the restrictions. ArbCom was clear that editors need to be informed: "''Prior to any sanctions being imposed, the editor in question shall be given a warning with a link to this decision by an uninvolved administrator; and, where appropriate, should be counseled on specific steps that he or she can take to improve his or her editing in accordance with relevant policies and guidelines.''"  Jossi has now been informed about it, both here and at his user talkpage, and has not made any reverts since he has been notified.  If any editors had concerns about his edit, they could have gone in and changed the text, and then the editing continues from there. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mVsmith: Seems I've heard something about ''ignorance of the law is no excuse...'' But I'm not saying Jossi should be sanctioned - just backing up the restrictions to ''level the playing field.'' Now that Jossi is fully aware of the restrictions then she can proceed along with the other editors to improve the article. rebuttal_labels::
