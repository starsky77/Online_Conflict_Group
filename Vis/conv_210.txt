{'text': 'This article claims, right off the bat, that \'\'Aryan\'\' means "noble", without even citing a source for it. First, the \'\'English\'\' word "Aryan" does most definitely \'\'not\'\' mean "noble", so the claim as such is simply wrong. Second, the meaning of the word (the etymon, to put it more technically precisely) as attested in Indo-Iranian languages is neither clear nor uniform. Its philology is notoriously complicated and thorny, and there are many open questions. It seems to have originally been an endonym among the Iranians (with meanings like "noble" really being \'\'secondary\'\'), whose derivation is completely obscure, while the meanings of formally similar terms in the earliest Sanskrit are varied and sometimes obscure and it\'s not even clear if and how they are related to the Iranian term (see Wiktionary for details). While the article later does cite three sources to the effect that the term means "noble", these sources are not technical sources written by cutting-edge researchers and experts but merely general reference works whose reliability and currency in such matters is often less than stellar. It may once have widely believed to have originally meant "noble", but contemporary researchers are much more cautious. As in Iranian, positive meanings like "noble" are thought to be \'\'secondary\'\' in Indo-Aryan, see wikt:आर्य#Sanskrit (where "noble" is not even mentioned; this meaning only seems to appear in Middle Indo-Aryan, apparently derived from the meaning "a member of the first three castes", which only attested later in Sanskrit and where an ethnic derivation suggests itself since the top three castes are the ones said to be correlated with the immigrant Indo-Aryans originally).', 'username': 'Florian Blaschke', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
