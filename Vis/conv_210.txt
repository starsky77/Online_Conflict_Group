At 5:07 day 1 Masipa J commences considering culpable homicide and the question of negligence. She stresses that although the test is objective, there are subjective elements involved. We must consider the circumstances of the case from Pistorius\'s perspective (5:10). At 5:13 she first identifies details such as failing to alert security that Pistorius was negligent in. She then returns to the objective tests in law as they relate to the circumstances and asserts around 5:16 that he was negligent in not foreseeing the posibility that he might kill the person behind the door. However in the case of Reeva Steenkamp, the person Pistorius was charged with murdering, she had already ruled (dealing with \'\'individualis\'\') that he did not foresee she might be in the toilet. On day 2 around 1:02 she reprised her judgment on the first count in the same terms.', 'username': '128.90.93.207', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Providing clarification']}

{'text': 'Reviewing my copy, I think it worth making two further points. Firstly that Masipa J reserved the form of words "clearly negligent" for Pistorius\'s actions (in ot calling security etc.) and not his foresight. Secondly, what I did not notice at first, is that the editor is flat out wrong to assert "One can be negligent without any foresight of killing someone, that would not amount to culpable homicide". The test for culpable homicide is that one ought to have foreseen the possibility of killing someone (in, say, firing a gun), whereas if it were must have forseen then the case would go to murder. In her reprise on day 2, Masipa J explicitly warned against the tendency of advancing from "ought" to "must" (the basis of her emphasis on subjectivity).', 'username': 'Dynamic IP from Chicago', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Providing clarification']}
{'text': '(ec) I am going to break my response down.\nSeveral editors have worked on the article. I think copy edits by various editors have corrupted the meaning of the sentence. [Judge Masipa] "said a reasonable person in the same circumstances would have and his actions were clearly negligent and culpable homicide thus a competent verdict" became "Judge Masipa said a reasonable person in the same circumstances would have foreseen this. In light of this, his actions were clearly negligent and culpable homicide was thus a competent verdict". I agree that wording is misleading, as reasonable foresight and his negligent actions have been conflated.\nWe can use the eNCA videos for verbatim quotes but we may not interpret what the judge said, reliable sources must do that for us and there are enough.\nThe David Dadic article is essentially an opinion piece, and can therefore only be used to source his opinion. Dadic (who I have never even heard of and I have followed this trial closely on multiple local and international TV channels) has disagreed with the judge\'s interpretation of the law, in a somewhat different respect to other local legal experts I might add. We have to present the judge\'s actual reasoning in the verdict section, not what one legal expert thought it should have been. If there is a section on reactions or appeal, we can include the legal opinions of all the experts disputing the judge\'s interpretation of the law, with attribution, there. It does not belong in the verdict section.\nThe BBC source clearly supports two different conclusions by the judge (emphasis mine): "\'Clearly he did \'\'\'not\'\'\' subjectively foresee this as a possibility, that he would kill the person behind the door, let alone the deceased as he thought she was in the bedroom at the time.\' .... \'Would a reasonable person in the same circumstances as the accused have foreseen the possibility that if he fired four shots whoever was behind the toilet might be struck and die as a result? She said the answer was \'\'\'yes\'\'\'. \'I am of the view that the accused acted too hastily and used excessive force. In the circumstances, it is clear that his conduct was negligent\'"', 'username': 'HelenOnline', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
{'text': "There are two aspects of reasonable foresight of killing someone the judge had to assess, the accused's subjective foresight which relates to a ''dolus eventualis'' verdict and the reasonable person's foresight which relates to a culpable homicide verdict. She came to different conclusions in each case, so clearly they are not the same thing. I think it is important to mention both. Sure, we can add other things the judge said in her verdict (e.g. Pistorius acted too hastily and used excessive force) but I don't think we should overwrite the foresight part. One can be negligent without any foresight of killing someone [i.e. neither the accused nor a reasonable person could have foreseen it], that would not amount to culpable homicide.

{'text': 'Yes, but the point of my edit was that Judge Masipa did not say Pistorius was "clearly" negligent in not foreseeing that he might kill the person behind the door. Objectively he was negligent in not foreseeing that, but there were subjective elements to consider as well.

At any rate Judge Masipa was at pains to point out other aspects of his actions which were negligent, and it was these aspects she described as "clearly" negligent: "I am of the view that the accused  acted too hasily and used excessive force. In the circumstances it is clear his conduct was negligent."
