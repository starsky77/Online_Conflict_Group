[31mMztourist: Some examples of display captions in the Museum (all spelling mistakes copied from captions): M48 caption "It was used by the 1st Puppet Army Cavalry Brigade, was chased by the Libration Troops on the way of fleeing..." On bomb display: "this bomb was used in Vietnam aggressive was by America Enpire" On M113: "was used to carry out its international obligation in 1978" T34: "Used to participate in combat and achieve glorious feat of arms in the South Laos Road no 9 campaign."

Steel stake: "used for fencing strategic hamlets to improson Vietnameses people (1955-60)" "Popular tools uses by the US and Puppet Army to repress and torture Vietnamese people in the 5th zone". Handcuff: "this was one of tool used to suppress Viet Nam peoples by Ngo Dinh Diem with U.S." "necklaces, bracelets, combs, sandals of children and a betel grinder of old people are the remains after the US and Puppet Army's murders."

[32mHCPUNXKID: Mmmm...following you POV, we must label as "X propaganda" (X being communist, fascist, capitalist, nationalist, etc...) every military museum that discredits or claim atrocities by their opponents...Sincerely, that's not a credible argument. I dont want to enter an edit war, but if you maintain that position you leave me with only two options: removing that category or adding a NPOV tag.I hope we can reach an agreement on this.KID rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mMztourist: If you can identify similar bias, such as the repeated use of "puppet", "mercenary", "murders" etc and outrageous claims such as a rifle used to kill 64 soldiers in other museums, then yes, they should be labelled as "X propaganda" too. In relation to your two options, you have a third option, stop picking a fight about the obvious bias of a museum that you haven't visited. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Stating your stance
[32mHCPUNXKID: First, the use of terms as "puppet", "mercenary", "murders", etc... on captions have as much to do with communism as with capitalism, that's it, nothing. So if your only argument for adding that category is the use of that terminology on captions, sorry, but you simply dont have any argument. Second, and I repeat it for the second time, it doesnt matter that I dont have visited that museum. Most WP users edit articles about places or events in wich they dont have been present, and obviously that doesnt disqualify them. Finally, it seems to me that you dont want to reach an agreement, as I gave you two options and you reject both, trying instead to impose your POV on this article.KID rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Repeated argument
[31mMztourist: Really???? Those words mean nothing? Do you seriously believe that? Repeated use of those terms is clear evidence that the Museum pushes a particular POV. I have only given the English captions, you can assume that the Vietnamese captions are even more biased. All Museums in Vietnam adopt the same propaganda tone because beating the French and the Americans is the sole basis for the Vietnamese Communist Party's legitimacy. English obviously isn't your first language so perhaps where you live these kind of terms are normal, but for a native English speaker they scream out propaganda. Who/what gives you the right to set out options anyway? You need to present a clear argument that the Museum isn't Communist propaganda before you go reverting the category or you can escalate this to another forum, in the meantime leave the category as it is. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mHCPUNXKID: No man, its you who have to undisputedly prove that the whole museum is "Communist propaganda", that's a severe accusation to label a whole museum, or in your case all the museums in Vietnam!?!. Again, most if not all military museums in the world would (more or less) discredit the enemies, so thats a very, very weak argument to make. Also, about "so perhaps where you live these kind of terms are normal, but for a native English speaker they scream out propaganda", Wikipedia (doesnt matter if its english version or other) aint made for english, spanish or vietnamese speakers, but for ALL people, despite the language they speak, the ideology they have or the country they came from. And finally, Who/what gives you the right to add unilaterally dubious POV-driven categories anyway? Making the majority of the article doesnt give you extra rights to decide about it, dude. Unless you gave serious proof of what you claim, I will delete that unjustified category, as it seems you added because of your political views, and that's not what Wikipedia is about...KID rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
