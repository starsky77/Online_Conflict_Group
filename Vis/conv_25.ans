[31mIlovetopaint: You know very well that the track was named in honor of Sean's band, and that mentioning it genuinely informs the context of the album. What is with these pedantic reverts? rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Stating your stance
[32m153.205.69.164: Could you provide the source that states "'Micro Disneycal World Tour' was named in honor of Microdisney"? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mIlovetopaint: This has already been satisfied by two references which observe the fact that a guy who was in a band called "Microdisney" remixed the album track called "Micro Disneycal World Tour". Even if the song wasn't actually named after the band (yeah right), the fact that a member of ''that'' band happened to remix ''that'' track would still be of encyclopedic interest. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32m153.205.69.164: To quote WP:SYNTH, in the Wikipedia, we are not allowed to "combine material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources". rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mIlovetopaint: Are you seriously suggesting that it's WP:SYNTH to establish encyclopedic context by noting the well-known bands that an individual musician hails from? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32m153.205.69.164: I'm serious. When we add a sentence like "'Micro Disneycal World Tour' was named in honor of Microdisney", the sentence has to be directly supported by the source. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mIlovetopaint: That wasn't what you removed. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32m153.205.69.164: The sources do not state that Sean O'Hagan is a co-founder of the High Llamas and Microdisney, which is why I quote WP:SYNTH. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32m153.205.69.164: Your edit does not satisfy WP:NOR concerns. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32m153.205.69.164: Besides, I have no idea what makes you want to mention only Sean O'Hagan in the article. As credited as "The Micro Disneycal World Tour (High Llamas Remix)" on iTunes and Spotify, for ''FM'', "The Micro Disneycal World Tour" was remixed by the High Llamas, not only Sean O'Hagan. Even the MTV source you added states that it is "the High Llamas' take on 'The Micro Disneycal World Tour'". He is not the remixer for "Micro Disneycal World Tour". Although Sean O'Hagan is a member of the High Llamas, the High Llamas is not Sean O'Hagan's one-man band. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
