[31mChetvorno: Which formula for the true period should be used? rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mCrowsnest: The nonlinear pendulum has been studied  and published about  for a long time. Eq. (2) is from a very recent publication, and has not been referenced (yet) in other publications, while the series in Eq. (1) (and similar series) are of widespread use. So, I would say that WP:UNDUE applies, and Eq. (2) should not be included. rebuttal_labels::

[36mZueignung: It looks like this arithmetic-geometric mean formula is not entirely novel; it appears as a combination of equations 3 and 15 in this Am J Phys paper by Carvalhaes and Suppes (vol. 26, no. 12, p. 1150). At any rate, I agree with those who say that it is fine material for the corresponding mathematics article but probably shouldn't be included here. It seems like a relatively obscure formula, and surely anyone who is interested in optimal methods of numerically computing the period of a pendulum will find their way to the full mathematics article. rebuttal_labels::

[35m193.233.212.18: Hiding the best formula formula is hardly consistent with the principles of the wikipedia for free and wide access to human knowledge. Even the question of removing it ought not be posed. Furthermore, it's well referenced and need not necessarliy be derived here. A more general derivation would be appropriate when the topic of elliptic integrals is being discussed.  â€” Preceding unsigned comment added by rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[33mDbfirs: I would challenge your claim that yours is the "best" formula, since it relies on an obscure mean, but at least we have a linked article to explain the obscurity.  I would tend to agree that the unusual formula (or perhaps both versions?) should go in the mathematical version of the article.  Should we just link to the other article for the more complex formulas? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[37mMartinvl: I agree with  that only one formula should be used.  This artcile, unlike the artcile Pendulum (mathematics) is about the physics of the pendulum. Since physicists often disregard "small terms", the first equation is the appropriate form to use - the reader can see immediately that for small Î¸, the Î¸2 can often be ignored while the Î¸4 becomes vanishingly small in practice.  This article rightly makes a reference to the mathematics of the pendulum, there is no need to clutter up the discussion here with equation 2 - an equation that cannot be easily programmed into an EXCEL spreadsheet. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mChetvorno: Also the article actually refers to the first equation; in Early observations in 1747  it tells how Bernoulli developed the method of using the 2nd term of the series ''Î¸02''/16 to correct the period of gravimeter pendulums for the finite length of swing. '''' rebuttal_labels::
