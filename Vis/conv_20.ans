[31mGreenC: Excessive tagging rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mGreenC: Everything in the article is well sourced so if you're going to insist on a tag then you will need to support it by listing what is factually inaccurate ie. which facts in the cited sources are not supported by the cited sources. That doesn't mean original research drawing on other sources to disagree with the cited sources, that is a separate issue and now what the factual accuracy tag is for. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mTonystewart14: There was a comment by  that is buried in the "Very Problematic" section above but basically says that the article needs more references other than Harden, similar to what  has been saying. I believe Step 1 should be to assemble a list of good references that have not already been used in this article and then go from there in writing and rewriting the article as needed to ensure reliability and NPOV. This is always difficult with subject matter like this, but will be easier once a bibliography is laid out first.
Here are a couple of references (tags removed) that were in the lead section in the past, but I removed these as the facts are already elsewhere and I wanted to avoid references in the lead. I wouldn't use these in the article, but want to mention them in case someone runs by them again.

[31mGreenC: Harden is Shin's official testimony and naturally takes up a big portion. If that's a problem his testimony can be found in other sources besides Harden. However Jack Upland and HerrGeisterhuhnmann have said that any source that supports Shin's testimony is biased, POV etc.. they are coming at this with a preconception that Shin's story is fundamentally unbelievable ''as a testimony'', and both have said so. This is a logical fallacy. Shin is widely considered to be a reliable witness and his account is broadly believed, there is no controversy or counter narrative with any weight (the DPNK version of events has no consensus). The few legitimate criticisms of Shin are already in the article and sourced. I'm not sure what we hope to accomplish by adding yet more sources in support of Shin's testimony, other than to make the Ref section have fewer "Hardens" when doing a visual scan of the page. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mJack Upland: Well, I think having less reliance on Harden would be an improvement. The problem, however, goes deeper. Most of these sources are effectively primary sources, by and large. Harden, as he himself acknowledges, is just repeating what Shin told him without verification, as are the journalists who base articles on interviews with Shin etc. It would be good to have a secondary source, which gives some assessment of Shin's testimony taken with other evidence, etc. This is what Felix Abt does, though not as well as it could be done. A good source would not need to counter Shin, but it would need to take up an independent, analytical stance. This is not merely my point of view: it is Wikipedia policy. Biographical articles should not be based on a first-person account. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mGreenC: Harden did more than just repeat Shin's version of events, he vetted the story, as he states: "the story '''has been vetted''' and rang true to survivors of other labor camps, to scholars, to human rights advocates, and to the South Korean government." (emphasis added). Harden is a journalist writing a biography in which he vetted the testimony (by way of other experts), it contains original analysis and a lengthy Notes section with dozens of sources besides Shin. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mJack Upland: That's so dishonest. Because Harden says the vetting did not turn up Shin's repeated lying. And Harden also says that Shin's story is unverifiable. Quotation given above. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH6: Refutation
[34mJack Upland: And Blaine Harden has now said that Shin has admitted he lied again, and revised the story for a second time. See reference in the article. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mTonystewart14: I think the changes Jack Upland made to the article just now regarding the inaccuracies in the original story look good. I also think that it could be expanded upon, so I'll work on that over the next few days and you all can let me know how it looks. I think if we cover this part and the video from his father contesting the story, we could remove the factual accuracy tag and cover all sides. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mJack Upland: I don't understand why the tag is such a big deal. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mTonystewart14: It's not just the tag itself, but the fact that the article's factual accuracy/NPOV is debated. That is the title of this section, after all. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mGreenC: I completely disagree that the changes Jack made look good. It is out of balance with what the rest of the world says about Shin Dong-hyuk. There is no "skepticism" about Shin Dong-hyuk except with two people: Jack Upland, and Felix Abt who is arguably not a reliable source. The United Nations, governments, experts, etc.. all say Shin is credible. Tony, ''show me a single source that is skeptical of Shin''' (beside Abt's 1-sentence comment). There is no justification for a section like this. It runs afoul of WP:WEIGHT, it's Jack Upland's personal biases twisting the sources to blow out of proportion something the rest of the world has not done. We don't create original research, synthesizing the source to build a case as to why people should be skeptical. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mJack Upland: Having thought about it, I think that the article needs a permanent tag of some kind until there's some definitive source to settle things one way or the other. The predominant source for the article is Shin himself, primarily as told to Harden. We now know that Shin has altered his story yet again, and that Harden's book is being revised. According to the report, Harden seems to have a bottomless faith in Shin, and believes in whatever the latest version is. I find Shin's inaccuracy very troubling, and Harden's blind acceptance of it even more so. This seems to go against the very basis of what a reliable source is. At the very least, surely we need to warn readers that Shin and Harden have retracted the existing story. It appears that no one is now asserting the factual accuracy of the article as it stands. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mGreenC: We're not supposed to write self-referentially eg. "This article.." rather state the facts and tag the problem. I've added an Update tag. I think we should keep the biography as written because we don't know the extent or seriousness of the changes. Based on the Post article it looks like he left things out, but didn't make stuff up. And everyone interviewed continues to support Shin's basic account. If he is a reliable source or not will be determined by the sources. If the UN, experts, etc.. continue to support him. It is more than just Harden and Shin that supports his account, for Wikipedia purposes he is still reliable because many support him. If there are detractors then we can weigh, but right now there is only 1, Felix, and he doesn't have much weight. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mJack Upland: I think NPOV is a different, but overlapping, issue from accuracy. I'm very concerned about editors like you, Green Cardamom, who claim to know what sources say when you haven't read them (and apparently you've never read Harden's book), and who dismiss them even when they are proven correct. Wikipedia is not a propaganda website for the DPRK, but equally it is not a propaganda website against them. Any neutral person would now acknowledge that Shin is now a very dubious source about anything. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Repeated argument
