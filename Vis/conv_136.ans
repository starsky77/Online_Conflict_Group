'The origins of the P-word, as its known in polite society, are far more recent than its black equivalent, which dates back to the 16th Century. Its first recorded use was in 1964, when hostility in Britain to immigration from its former colonies in the Asian sub-continent, was beginning to find a voice.''
The dictionary backs up the word's defination and the article ''very'' clearly says what you 'failed' to find. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mDarkness Shines: Were there does it say the term originated in the UK? There is a world of difference between first recorded use and origin. And please note, it does not say first recorded use was in the UK. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mTopGun: How much more clear does it have to be? It is clearly mentioning the origin and giving a reference to the first recorded use. A serious question, are you that naive or purposely trolling? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mDarkness Shines: No, it does not. Please seek a third opinion or ask at the reliable sources notice board. Note, the dictionary definition does not support the edit either. Assuming you used Merriam Websters. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mTopGun: I've given you a quotation above. You are out-rightly denying it. And good luck proving BBC non RS at RSN if you want that. You also have a very recent editwar history  on this article. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mDarkness Shines: Were in the quote does it say the term originated in the UK? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mTopGun: If it is so hard for you to  read from even the trimmed quote... Starting with, "''The origins of the P-word''" and referring to "''Its first recorded use was in 1964, when hostility in Britain''" and the first recorded use can directly be taken as origin as well per your pet policy of verifiability. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mDarkness Shines: You are engaging in WP:OR Two sentences, first says "P*ki" is newer than "N*gger" that is all it says. The second says the first recorded use was in the UK. The source does not say the term originated in the UK at all. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH4: Repeated argument
[32mTopGun: That's because you just dissected the prose. It is a single sentence in a flow and refers clearly to it and further clearly says that the first recorded use was there. And what ever way you take it, Wikipedia does not consider what is true or was the real origin in this case, it will take the first recorded use as the origin. Get it now? There's just evidence building up against you for 3 edit wars yesterday, removing citations at Taliban article after consensus was established and now wasting time here. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mAshLin: Adding a second opinion, as per language of the BBC article, I think it means what TopGun has added. Is there another interpretation likely of the BBC prose? I think not. BTW a tip - do keep in mind at all times the need to avoid close paraphrasing. Not that it has happened here, but often attempting to avoid close paraphrasing creates a slight change in meaning. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mTopGun: That might have been DS's aim which would still be incorrect and POV. This was just not wanting to listen. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument

[36m65.0.158.161: The origin of a word and its first recorded use can be two separate issues. For example, read the BBC article this way: "The origins of the F-word, as its known in polite society, are far more recent than its C-word equivalent, which dates back to the ___th Century. Its first recorded use was in ______" Read like this, it would be understood that 'origin' and 'first recorded use' are very different, as we might have data on the first recorded use of the F-word, yet we may not know its precise origins, and the article itself does not say where/when the word originated. This Wikipedia article should reflect what the source says, which is that the first recorded use was in the UK. As it stands, the Wiki article says that the term originated in the UK, which the BBC article does not say. The M. Webster definition that I've look at also says 'first recorded use' rather than origin. To clarify how important that is, see: http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fuck which includes both an 'origin' and 'first recorded use', both being distinct from each other.
For further clarification, see how this issue is handled @ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okay and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_rarebit. Origin and first recorded use are treated as separate. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[35m65.0.149.160: As I cannot edit the article myself, someone should be prepared to correct, add an addition reliable source, or remove the statement in question. Reason: Neither current sources say where the term originated; rather, both say that the first recorded use was in Britain. If there is a dispute about what the BBC article actually means, then an additional RS should be included to confirm the meaning. Otherwise, edit the article to reflect what the sources say, because as it stands, it constitutes OR. At the very least, it should be flagged as OR in a timely manner until someone can properly edit it. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mDarkness Shines: Currently nobody can edit this article, you need to use the {{editprotect}} template to get an admin to do it. rebuttal_labels:: 
[35m65.0.149.160: Oops. Oh well. The request edit page says the protection expires in 2 days, unless I read it wrong. Will wait until then. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mTopGun: Please form a consensus here before editing this regardless of the protection. rebuttal_labels:: 
[35m65.0.149.160: Consensus is not needed to remove OR. If you feel the BBC source does say that the term originated in Britain, then feel free to add an additional source confirming this so there can be no dispute about the meaning. The dictionary source does not say this, as that particular dictionary separates 'origin' and 'first recorded use' generally and specifically with this term. I've went through several dictionaries now, and it varies from origin unknown to plain not listing origin at all. Not a single case of 'Origin: Britain'. However, almost all the dictionaries, with few exceptions, list the first recorded use, and always in Britain. As I mentioned above, if another RS can back up the origin issue, then fine. If not, the OR must be removed. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mTopGun: What you think is OR is disputed by two editors above, so this does not make it a simple remove the OR question. See the reasons above. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35m65.0.149.160: Again, you (or anyone else) are free to add an additional RS to confirm the meaning of the BBC article. I won't willy-nilly edit the page the moment it becomes unprotected, but within a reasonable amount of time the statement should be edited to reflect what both sources currently say, unless an additional RS (as the meaning seems to be in dispute) is added. When what a source says is disputed, it is generally good form to add an additional RS to confirm it. I am certainly open to an opposing view, but I don't see an issue with simply rewording the statement to something along the lines of "Its first recorded use was..." After all, you seem to suggest that 'origin' and 'first recorded use' are interchangeable, while I am saying they are not interchangeable. If you are correct, there is no harm done in editing it. Cheers. EDIT: I forgot to mention, the BBC article is an editorial, and the Wiki manual states that when an editorial is used as a source, and dispute arises about it, it is proper to add an additional source. Cheers. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH5: Counterargument
