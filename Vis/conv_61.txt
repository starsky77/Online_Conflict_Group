{'text': "I have not used 'talk' before so I hope this reaches you.  I am sorry that you personally do not know the Wuorinen works - but they are indeed major contributions to the repertoire.  I can give you names of a dozen players that can confirm this. Both published by CF Peters.   The Concerto - written for the Raschers and performed throughout Europe and the US, and the duo hundreds of times throughout the world by many players (there are at least two recordings so far).  If you are inclding Glass, Denisov and Husa others should be added (that you are not aware of).  Isn't that the point of wikipedia?   Also any sax player interested in 20th century music would immediately think of the Webern and the Wolpe...but maybe they need to be in a separate section, major chamber works?\nAnother major composition I just thought of Tristan Keuris - his Saxophone Quartet Concerto and Sax Quartet have been widely performed, and are very highly regarded. And what about the Berio Sequenza IXb for alto saxophone (1981)?\nFinally on solos in orchestra works I'm sure some of the Del Tredici 'Alice' piece have such but I need to confirm with the publisher Boosey and Hawkes.", 'username': 'Hstokar', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Providing clarification']}

Can you please show me that they are standards in the repertoire and that they were recorded by well-known saxophonists before we include them? Are any of these pieces experimental or atonal? I have heard of the Xenakis and Berio pieces. The Xenakis could stay, but I think that should be the only piece of experimental or atonal music included in the article.
