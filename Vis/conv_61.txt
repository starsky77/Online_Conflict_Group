{'text': 'The recent edit by 96.231.117.108 smacks far too much of political advertising, which is far beyond any standard of neutrality. Lines like "Congressman McHenry has fought for adequate veterans\' health care for his district." are clearly stuff from his own campaign- any Congressman in the world would say the same thing, and it\'s not necessary to list out his individual votes like merit badges for an overgrown boy scout. If someone doesn\'t edit this, I may, but we need to somehow retain the important information and get rid of the blatant self-promotion going on here.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by', 'username': '71.76.189.11', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
