[31mWilliam JJ: Overemphasis on Gaffes rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mWilliam JJ: I can agree that the "potatoe" gaffe belongs in the article.  But going beyond that is overdoing it.  Obama has also made a fair number of gaffes, and they are not mentioned in his article at all.  In light of that precedent, I think including the "potatoe" gaffe goes far enough. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mWilliam JJ: Hellooooooo; Earth to anyone interested  if no one posts here, I will assume that my recent edit removing references to gaffes should be included, undo the revert, and insist that my version has been approved on the talk page. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mDoug Weller: Quayle is probably best known today for his gaffes. Your version has not been approved on the talk page, and silence is not consent. Please don't remove the material again. Thanks. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mWilliam JJ: Well, according to BRD, the third step is "discuss".  How can you discuss an issue if one side is silent?  This still seems undue.  For example, Obama has had quite a few gaffes, and there have been jokes about TOTUS, but neither appears in his article. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH4: Repeated argument
[34mNomoskedasticity: I agree with the judgment that gaffes are what Quayle is best know for.  If you feel that the same is true for Obama, then perhaps raise it on that talk page. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mCanoe1967: Just a thought. Is there a 'political gaffes' article yet? We could just lump them all there for anyone that wants to see how many others there are and compare on their own? rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[31mWilliam JJ: I'm not aware of one.  I like the idea, though. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mCanoe1967: I started the article. We need to make it acceptable before it gets deleted though. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mNomoskedasticity: It won't mean deleting material from this article. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mWilliam JJ: That's a separate issue. rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mArzel: That he is known for some gaffes does not mean that he is defined by them.  As such the VP section is largely a BLP violation presenting undue weight on his misstatements. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mArzel: Ha, you are funny.  You know there is no way in hell that the protectorate of Obama will allow this kind of crap on the Obama article, why even make the statement. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mNomoskedasticity: Perhaps you could tell us what else he is known for  and present the sources that substantiate any assertions along those lines. rebuttal_labels:: 
[33mTarc: I'd think in this case I'd have to say that Dan Quayle is indeed primarily defined by his clumsy speech and word choices of the past.  We're going on 25 years now from when it all happened and it is still a frequent citation, not anything he did in COngress or as a VP. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[37mBlueMoonlet: Hi.  I was just stopping by, saw the tag, and thought I would offer an evaluation.  In the Vice Presidency section, I count three paragraphs detailing Quayle's gaffes, two more on the Murphy Brown speech (which was not a gaffe and is not presented as one; note the supporting quote from Bergen herself), and three short paragraphs at the beginning describing other aspects of his Vice Presidency.  The article overall has something like 20 paragraphs (that's an estimate, not a count).
My judgment is that the three paragraphs on gaffes are appropriate.  All of the items listed are well-known, and an article on Quayle would be incomplete without them.  If you are concerned about WP:UNDUE weight, then I would suggest you add more material about other things he did as Vice President.   / rebuttal_labels:: DH7: Refuting the central point
[31mWilliam JJ: Not a bad idea, actually. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mRanskip: I agree that the section of this article describing gaffes is accurate and appropriate as written, and may even understate the issue.  The events cited are well known facts, and many additional incidents took place that are not cited.  Removal of any part of the present article would be distorting truth.  Dan Quayleâ€™s intelligence and competence to serve were serious issues to many Americans in the 1992 election, including many in his own party.  This was among the primary factors attributed to the Bush administrationâ€™s failure to win re-election.
