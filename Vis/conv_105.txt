{'text': 'There are two serious problems with a recent edit of the section Evidence base by , which prompted me to partially revert it: 1) the edit completely removed – without acknowledgment, explanation or justification - the existing content of the section and the associated link to a relevant evidence resource;\n2) the table that was inserted misrepresents the contents of the cited source and the relevant table in that source; in particular, by its incorrect and misleading addition of the term “no effect” in relation to various disorders and treatments.', 'username': 'Marschalko', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
{'text': 'My bad with the revert but how is the image misleading? Its based on the specific table from the study.', 'username': 'CartoonDiablo', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Conceding / recanting', 'Coordinating edits']}
{'text': 'The image contains assertions with very significant implications that are not contained in the original table or article, ie, the addition of "No effect". The misleading effect of that addition is highlighted when the content of the article as a whole - and in particular, another table in the article, "Effects of family therapies depending on disorder" - are considered.\nFurther, this is only one study - albeit a meta-analysis - and in a field like family therapy, where issues of evidence and research are so vexed and contentious, it is arguably not prudent to present a single table like that (even without additional errors) as being definitive or representative of the state of evidence overall. And in any case, the article is getting a bit old, and, as the first sentence in the section says, the evidence base is evolving.', 'username': 'Marschalko', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Providing clarification']}
{'text': 'Well it\'s not just a review, it\'s a tertiary source meaning it reviewed 100+ reviews. That aside the "no effect" is what the study says, it looked at the therapy and if no significant improvement was found it was seen as ineffective (and therefore not listed on the table).', 'username': 'CartoonDiablo', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'The article does not say anywhere that family therapy - or any intervention - has "no effect" in relation to any disorder. The closest it comes is in saying that psychodynamic treatment for schizophrenia has "Little or no effect". And it does not say or imply that any treatment is "ineffective" for anything. I think your interpretation of the article is not correct. The article is useful and it should be cited; but it certainly does not support the interpretation that you have proposed. And it has its own limitations and, given the state of evidence for the field as a whole, it should not be accorded the prominence that you seek to give it (even without incorrect interpretations).', 'username': 'Marschalko', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': "Further, I have just checked and have discovered that you have already had a similar dispute re the same issue on the Psychoanalysis page. Evidently you have some personal investment in that table and I don't intend to go through all those same arguments again. For the reasons stated previously, the table is an inappropriate addition to this (and arguably, any) article.", 'username': 'Marschalko', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument', 'DH4: Repeated argument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': "That study would be in the article meaning the article did in fact say that family therapy is ineffective at xyz disease. And in the former we reached a dispute resolution (although the other editor didn't abide by it resulting in two subsequent blocks). As far as I can tell you haven't given an actual reason for excluding the image, its an exact reflection of the study which is rather good seeing as how it looked at 100+ reviews. I'll reinstate it for now and if it becomes an issue we can go to dispute resolution.", 'username': 'CartoonDiablo', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
