{'text': 'Looking at the Dutch page, that page has problems. One of the biggest is their chart of genocides, with its aggressor column, under which whole ethnic and religious groups are labeled "aggressors", implying that every ethnicityA person is guilty even if they didn\'t participate or even opposed the actions of their kinsmen (probably in some government or army) who perpetrated crimes against people of ethnicityB. I see that, and think that this is definitely not a page English Wikipedia should emulate... And by the way, that list is far more arbitrary than the one here. They omit various genocides that actually have official recognition, and yet they include things such as the Lebanese Muslims and Christians somehow simultaneously performing genocide upon one another (which is uncited on the page as well). I think perhaps the incomplete Dutch Wikipedia article should use the English Wikipedia as a model, not the other way around, especially considering that the Dutch page uses 3 references, whereas its English counterpart uses over 400.', 'username': 'Calthinus', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
