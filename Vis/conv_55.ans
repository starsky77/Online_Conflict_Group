[31mHusond: Republic of Kosovo redirect rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mHusond: Users Beamathan and Dbachmann have set out to change the target of this redirect (until now redirecting to Kosovo) to Kosovo#Republic of Kosovo, thus leading to a tiny section of this article. In my view, this is just another POV disruption, as this move pretends to alienate the republic from the region, as if users searching for "Republic of Kosovo" were supposed to be searching for a small note on what would be an unimportant detail about Kosovo. Not the case. Every matter regarding the Republic of Kosovo is related to Kosovo itself, like it or not, therefore users searching for "Republic of Kosovo" should be redirected to the top of this article. Furthermore, I don't think there's ever been a consensus for this re-targeting of the redirect. Feedback is welcome. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mNOAH: Actually I agree with you that Beamthan is acting like he owns the Kosovo article and he is the one who decides what the article should contain, where it should link etc etc. Nice to see that I am not the only one who has seen the bias and is speaking out. Have a nice evening. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mBeamathan: Noah, I'm so sorry that your edits haven't been reasonable. Good luck in the future buddy. And this article, Kosovo, is about Kosovo. We have a section about RoK. This section should be expanded, I have asked our Kosovo experts to help us on that, but to no avail. I hope it gets done shortly. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mNOAH: You have asked the Kosovo experts? Maybe you don't know that since according to your edit log you entered Wikipedia a few weeks ago, but you should know that I consider myself a Kosovo/Balkan-expert and have contributed in Kosovo-related articles for almost three years. In the end I repeat that I still consider your edits biased rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[36mRevolving Bugbear: I would like to remind everyone to '''''comment on the edits, not on the editor''''' and to remain civil and maintain etiquette. This applies to everyone and is not optional. - rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[34mBeamathan: Noah, I have no bias. You obviously are an ROK supporter, and are as a result biased. It's pretty evident. However this doesn't mean that you can't rise above it. Please, assist us in the Republic of Kosovo section of the article. We need people who are knowledgeable on the RoK, and the situation on the ground. Just remember to use proper sources. Goto this talk section Talk:Kosovo#Calling_all_REPUPBLIC_OF_KOSOVO_experts and discuss your proposals. We need the help and if you are as you claim, you could help us. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mHusond: Beam, you don't need to tell other editors what to do and how to do it. This "calling on Republic of Kosovo experts" (if there's actually such thing since the subject is merely 3 months old and that's hardly enough time for someone to get a PhD on the matter) is not how we function. Calling others biased also not how we function. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[34mBeamathan: Husond, I am not telling people how to do it. I am simply presenting the best way to edit such a contentious article. Do you disagree with discussing a content change prior to making it, if it has a chance to be controversial? I think that's common sense. Also in the case of providing the WP:IDONTLIKEIT link I was just trying to assist someone. Then after being insulted, I linked WP:AGF which would have prevented my insult if good faith was assumed. I don't see how providin information on WIkipedia is "telling people how to do it." And as far as the RoK section goes, we really need some RoK experts to help with the section. I'm no expert, regardless of how much reading and studying on the subject I've done. We have editors that live in Kosovo, that may be able to form the section in a better way than I would. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH5: Counterargument
[31mHusond: Beam, a user living in Kosovo would not make him or her an expert. A Kosovar's personal experience on the ground would equal to original research, which we are not looking for. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mBeamathan: Maybe you didn't read what I said. Perhaps those people who live there, or are very well versed in the area would be better suited to help form this section. Cited reliable sources are of course necessary, and an NPOV is of course needed as well. However, I figured these people would want to help with that particular part of the article. rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mBalkanFever: Can we stop with the experts thing, please? Beam, I know what you are trying to say, but this petty discussion on who is an expert is absolutely useless. Back to the problem: Husond, I disagree with you. The majority of people that type in "Republic of Kosovo" would be looking for the partially-recognised state, which is why they are being specific, as opposed to only typing in "Kosovo". Ideally, Republic of Kosovo would be its own article, and we would not have this problem, but I am reluctant to start a split discussion for fear of bringing back the nationalist rants, among other things. '''''' rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH5: Counterargument
[31mHusond: I really don't agree. Users searching for "Republic of Kosovo" could be searching for many different aspects e.g. the population of the Republic of Kosovo, or maybe the history of the Republic of Kosovo long before it became a republic. So many things really, and all of them are covered in the article as a whole. Limiting the search to a sub-section with basic notions about the republic really doesn't make sense to me. On a related and very relevant note, I find it quite inconsistent that some users are pushing for Republic of Kosovo to redirect to Kosovo#Republic of Kosovo, whereas Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija still happily redirects to Kosovo and not to Kosovo#Autonomous Province under UN administration. I was not surprised with this blatant lack of neutrality. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[35mBalkanFever: Well, to me, this whole thing is a bit on the WP:LAME side, since redirects are cheap, but you guys can have your arguments. I'd just rather that this didn't escalate to incivility. '''''' rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH4: Stating your stance
[31mHusond: ? rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mBalkanFever: What I mean is, your (all of you) edit summaries weren't very productive, especially over a fairly trivial issue. Even though I disagreed with you, Husond, I am content with a redirect to the top of the page, just as I am also content with a redirect to the section. I fail to see how it makes that big a difference. '''''' rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[33mDbachmann: Republic of Kosovo is (at present) a redirect to this article. This article contains a section called "Republic of Kosovo". It is thus a section redirect (). Don't turn everything into a big drama, there is no cabal. Sheesh. I'm still waiting for Husond's first ''constructive'' contribution to the Kosovo topic. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mNOAH: I agree once again with Husond. Most of the people will not search "Republic of Kosovo" but only Kosovo BUT expect to find information about the Republic of Kosovo. Most countries have the prefix "the Republic" but this is not used by Wikipedia, e.g. Croatia instead of Republic of Croatia, Albania instead of Republic of Albania. For me and for most people of the world there is no difference between Kosovo and RoK. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[37m128.206.162.135: Delete it all. This article on accuracy and quality is a 1/5.  â€”Preceding unsigned comment added by rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mHusond: I am appalled at your comment. First, I've made many ''constructive'' contributions to this topic, regardless of what you consider "constructive". Second, even if I hadn't, I am still within my right to discuss and be involved in this topic or any other topic whenever I wish. Third, you are turning this into a drama more than I am, everything was fine until you've decided to modify the redirect without discussing it first. Fourth, "drama" as a matter of fact is not my definition of a complaint. Your attitude dwells into WP:OWN, and by not even commenting on my bringing up the fact that Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija redirects to the top of the article and not to a section, which by the way you have redirected yourself and which constitutes obvious double standards, I think that you are also dwelling into WP:POV. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion, DH5: Counterargument
[32mNOAH: I totally disagree with you, Dbachmann. After reading many of Husond's answers to you and other people here at the Kosovo article, I am convinced that Husond is a very constructive contributor and his help and contribution to make Kosovo-articles more NPOV is more than welcome. Until now all Husond's answers have been very reasonable. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mBeamathan: Yes quite, when someone agrees you with it's easy to say that you are "convinced they are a very constructive contributor." I'm tiring of people putting their POV above the article. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mHusond: Whereas someone who does not agree with you, is not. That's not a good philosophy. Please stop disrupting the redirect, trying to enforce your changes without consensus and then accusing users reverting them of also going against consensus is not a good philosophy either. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[34mBeamathan: I've given up. You don't care about the facts, only your POV Pushing. Does having it redirect to the article in general make the RoK more legitimate or something? Are you really that sick with bias? I can't describe how disgusting such a strong bias is. Really. I can't put into text how maddening it is to deal with your POV Pushing. If you want to try this over the phone, I can email you my number and perhaps with the facts and logic actually spoken to you you'd understand. Or you're being malicious and no revelation can change that. I'm all done with that redirect. As BalkansFever says, I'll have to choose the instances of NPOV to fight for, instead of each and every little one. Good luck with your POV Pushing. You seem to have a great ally in your cause in Noah. Have fun! rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH0: Name calling/hostility, DH-1: Bailing out
[32mNOAH: I should be reading now and not discuss but I just have to answer you. I believe, maybe because of the short time you have been here, you have the wrong approach on how to edit, and maintain NPOV on this article. You can say other people are putting their POV above the article, but the same can we say about you. Without wanting to insult you, I can say you are not the most neutral editor on this article. Again, without wanting to insult, based on what I have seen of your edits I am seeing a pro-Serb or maybe anti-Kosovo independence bias. You have still not given a reasonable answer why we should not remove the sentence I proposed under "Rule of law". You say discussion first before edit and than you don't discuss. How should e interpret it? rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mNOAH: Me, and based on what I have read, also Husond, are fighting for NPOV. While some others (from now on I will try to not use names) are using what us Wikipedians call "Trolling" to disrupt developing Kosovo article towards NPOV. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mHusond: I am nobody's ally. This rant was really unnecessary, aggressive and overdramatic. I can't really see how do you plan to have any credit on fighting for NPOV after comments like this. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[34mBeamathan: Husond, my credibility comes from my actions. And I'm sorry, but I just don't understand your intentions. I'll let your actions stand for what they are and comment no further on the redirect. It's really too bad though. rebuttal_labels:: DH-1: Bailing out
[34mBeamathan: And Noah (I will use names to be specific), what isn't NPOV? I told you SEVERAL times. Discuss anything you think isn't NPOV. Other than deleting credible sourced items, and trying to add biased content to the article I haven't seen you "help" much. I'm looking forward to it though. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mIkonicDeath: As this has to do with the redirect.
Taiwan has two articles, one about the region, and one about the Republic of China (Taiwan) and Taiwan is recognized by far less countries then Kosovo (not that it makes Taiwan less important), further more on that point Kosovo is recognized by the majority of the worlds most powerful countries.
Therefore I suggest there be a similiar situation as Taiwan, where we have one article on the region that has been historically considered Kosovo and another article on the Republic of Kosovo.

[35mBalkanFever: There have been many long discussions about this, and apparently the situation now was the consensus. I actually agree with you, so if you want to formally propose a , by all means go ahead, but it will take a while to reach a consensus. Not to mention the possibility of incivility and nationalism from some users returning. '''''' rebuttal_labels::

[32mNOAH: Unfortunately you continue to offend other editors. Have you read what I have written until now on this talk page? The quote that is included in the "Rule of Law" section is not conform NPOV rules that Wikipedia have. The quote is included mainly for propaganda purposes but you have never discussed and instead just reverted my edits. But if no one is against removing the quote I will go ahead with the edit where the quote will be removed. Please don't act like you own Wikipedia. It belongs to all of us. I would also like to know when did I add biased content?? Apart from removing the propaganda quote I updated the constitution section and is this what you are calling POV? The only thing I did was to write the constitution was approved. With personal attacks instead of discussiing the topic you are only proving I was right when I used some adjectives you did not like to describe you. This is my last answer to you. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH3: Policing the discussion, DH-1: Bailing out
[32mKosova2008: The biggest contributers on all Kosova or Kosovo articles seem to hate having to share the power of editing. They get offended if someone points out the fact that the article lacks credibility or neutrality. Husond I'm sure you've noticed this yourself, a split would be a great way to let the user decide if he/she rather read about Republic of Kosova or Kosovo (geography). rebuttal_labels::
