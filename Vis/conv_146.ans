[31m47.55.7.119: coffin draped in Nazi colours rebuttal_labels:: 
[31m47.55.7.119: There are issues with this claim "His coffin was draped in the Nazi colours." in the Death section of the article.  A video of his funeral is available on youtube, and it shows this claim to be spurious at best.  The video (seen here ) shows a red-black-white ribbon adorning his coffin with the words "Ordensgemeinschaft der Ritterkreuztr√§ger" (Association of Knight's Cross Recipients). You will also see later in the video, members of his procession carrying a wreath adorned with a ribbon in the Austrian colours immediately following his medal bearer.  Seeing as there is easy misunderstanding of colours in this case to mean a military flag (as is often done at military funerals), I think it should be reworded to accurately represent the truth. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mSlightsmile: I added an inline '''dispute tag''' in the article after "draped in the Nazi colours". rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mZero0000: Note that neither the source nor our text say "Nazi flag".  Only "Nazi colours".  The ribbon adorning his coffin has the same colours as the Nazi flag. So, unless the Ordensgemeinschaft der Ritterkreuztr√§ger had those same colours independently of the Nazi colours (which I think is highly unlikely), our text is correct. It could be improved, though. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31m47.55.7.119: The issue is with the wording, not with the combination of different tinctures.  "Colours" in a military context means a specific type of flag, saying his casket was draped in Nazi colours makes it sound like it was draped in a flag like one usually sees at a military funeral. Since the Association's ribbon takes their colours from the order's ribbon, it's slightly ludicrous to tie it to the swastika flag instead of the association it specifically states the ribbon represents. Note that the Knight's Cross was "denazified" after the war but maintained the same ribbon, to say they are the "nazi colours" is to conflate very different things. Would Feldgrau not also be a "nazi colour"?  Would someone wearing a black suit be said to wear the SS colour? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31m47.55.7.119: The source also says in the same sentence that he was buried by his comrades, but the video clearly shows young students from his former Studentenverbindung being the pallbearers.  It's fairly safe to say that this was journalistic creative writing rather than actual research into his funeral, since it only has one sentence in the whole article about it. rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[36mChartreuxCat: I agree the wording is a bit odd, especially since the colours used were the same colours used by the Kaiserreich. Maybe colours should be changed to "flag". I'm aware that colours is often used to mean "flag" by native english speakers, but english wikipedia is used by the whole world, especially because he english wikipedia is the most neutral one. I'm sure many who read this think "nazi colours" means "black/white/red" which leads to misinformation.
While i'm at it. I'm a bit confused about using privately owned pictures on wikipedia. A relative of mine was attending Otto Skorzeny's funeral and i inherited these, many of the pictures show the coffin and flag used in colour. I'd be happy to provide one of those pictures to the article to help if it's possible. Thanks in advance rebuttal_labels:: 
[31m47.55.7.119: Was it an actual flag or a ribbon on the coffin in the photos you have? The video I linked to only shows a ribbon with the aforementioned inscription. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31m47.55.7.119: As for using your own pictures, see Wikipedia:Image use policy.  I'm sure your photos would be welcome and a useful addition to the article. rebuttal_labels::
