{'text': 'Last week\'s edits on time crystals misstate the connection to the article topic. The sources cited (or at least Cowen, Powell, and Gibney which I can access) confirm that time crystals violate time translation symmetry. They also add that time crystals are a type of perpetual motion. But they do not add that time crystals violate the conservation of energy. In fact Cowen states that "This type of perpetual motion machine would not violate any known physical law because no energy could be extracted from the system without first adding energy.", and Gibney says "Time crystals are hypothetical structures that pulse without requiring any energy". The Time crystal article provides a more correct statement in its Thermodynamics section. I will attempt to revise the sentence in this article.', 'username': 'Dirac66', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits', 'Providing clarification']}
{'text': 'Sorry but this is not correct: time translation symmetry defines conservation of energy, thus if a system violates time translation symmetry it violates conservation of energy by definition. When we talk about "laws of physics" what we really mean is the symmetries of equations. As wilzciek states coyly in his original paper " Fields or particles in the presence of a time crystal background will be subject to energy-changing processes, analogous to crystalline Umklapp processes. In either case the apparent non-conservation is in reality a transfer to the background."  . While the experiments performed thus far are driven by lasers, in principle a time crystal can be driven by the quantum vacuum at absolute zero i.e. empty space. In fact it is this is the same type of perpetual motion / broken symmetry as say that of the spin of an electron. The concept of energy doesn\'t really apply to these nonlinear systems for the same reason it doesn\'t really apply in general relativity.', 'username': 'Sparkyscience', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH7: Refuting the central point'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': ',  is right and the wilzciek quote makes this clear. The word "apparent" before "non-conservation" is to indicate that there is not really any non-conservation. The equations for the time crystal may not have time translation symmetry but this is only because the crystal is being treated as a fixed background. If the dynamics of the background are also included then the underlying equations have time-symmetry and energy conservation holds with energy being transferred to and from the background. Actually the situation in general relativity is exactly the same and energy is conserved there too. I don\'t think time-crystals should be discussed here at all and certainly not in the opening section. It would be better to clarify the status of energy conservation for time-crystals on their own page', 'username': 'Weburbia', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': ', I agree that the non-conservation is only apparent as per Wilczek\'s paper. But that is not what this Wikipedia article now says. The statement in the intro that "new states of matter violate ... the conservation of energy" can be taken by a naïve reader to mean that scientists have recently discovered how to "violate" the conservation of energy. So some change to the article is needed please, in order to explain that the effect is only apparent and is driven by the quantum vacuum. If my version is unsatisfactory, could one of you two please insert a better one?\nI also agree that this topic should not be in the intro where it may confuse beginning readers just starting to learn about conservation of energy. But I do think it should have a section further down for more advanced readers who have heard the news about time crystals and want to see what this article says about them. As I said above, the Time crystal article already provides a more correct statement in its Thermodynamics section.', 'username': 'Dirac66', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Providing clarification', 'Coordinating edits']}

{'text': 'I have removed the section about time crystals because it is clearly not a violation of energy conservation as pointed out by . I tend to agree with  that this is a neolgism and too specific to be included here. This seems to be the result of a misleading headline mentioning perpetual motion.

{'text': 'I wrote the majority of the time crystal article in its current form, including the thermodynamics section in this edit here . The thermodynamics section is not ideal as it was written some time ago and treats the time crystal system as an equilibrium system (which have been proven to be impossible), the time crystals discovered most definitely partake in energy processes, but the current thermodynamics section is unfortuately one of the few sources in the literature that directly address the issue (ie. laws of thermodynamics) head on at this current time. In any normal sense, time crystals, as discovered, violate conservation of energy, and they are the first state of matter known to do so. They are therefore, obviously, an important discovery (possible Nobel prize next year? Things have been handed out for less...). Yes if you take the background into account symmetry is restored as in GR, but I agree with Sean Carrol here in his article titled "Energy is not conserved"  "I personally think it’s better to forget about the so-called “energy of the gravitational field” and just admit that energy is not conserved, for two reasons..." No average person includes empty space when considering conservation laws, nor will they understand the key point if we do include it. All nonconservations can be viewed as a transfer to the vacuum but we don\'t usually claim that "spontaneous symmetry breaking" isn\'t really symmetry breaking at all!...Time crystals "bend the cast-iron laws of thermodynamics" .', 'username': 'Sparkyscience', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}

{'text': 'What is most key is that readers of "conservation of energy" understand the domain of where this law of physics applies - namely closed linear systems that have time translational symmetry. Where this is not the case, in open nonlinear systems, like high energy plasmas , gravitating systems  and time crystals the conservation of energy does not apply. I would argue time crystals are probably the best example here, because in others there is the temptation to think energy is "borrowed" from somewhere else, which is not the case.

{'text': "You seem to be claiming that energy conservation is only for linear static systems. Energy conservation works for all systems, linear or non-linear, where the dynamical equations are time-translation invariant, including time crystals and general relativity. Anything that changes breaks translation symmetry dynamically. What is special about the time crystal is that it changes while in its ground state, i.e. time-translation is broken spontaneously. This does not mean that energy conservation is violated. It is the equations that need to be invariant, not the solution. Ordinary crystals spontaneously break translation symmetry but they don't violate momentum conservation. You can't use crystals to generate a reactionless engine and you can't use time crystals to generate energy, nor is energy conservation violated in any other way. To be able to say something in wikipedia you need a reliable source. None of the sources cited (reliable and otherwise) say that energy is not conserved.", 'username': 'Weburbia', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'crystalline systems are not invariant under arbitrary translations, therefore, strictly speaking, momentum is not conserved."\nCrystals do not conserve momentum. This is basic textbook physics stuff. Thats why rather then talk about momentum in crystals we talk about Quasimomentum. And Umklapp scattering demonstrates quite clearly what momentum violations looks like. Without momentum violations key properties of crystals would not be present.\nWith time crystals the same principle applies (we use the term "quasienergy" instead of energy because technically energy is not conserved). When i talk about linear i mean the "linear equations", sorry for not making that clear, where you can separate variables, i\'m not referring to the value of the equations. i.e. per what i wrote here:"Symmetries apply to the equations that govern the physical laws rather than the initial conditions, values or magnitudes of the equations themselves and state that the laws remain unchanged under a transformation. . With nonlinear i am referring to equations where you cannot separate variables.', 'username': 'Sparkyscience', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': "If you treat a crystal as a fundamental structure without continuous translation symmetry then the system will have only quasimomentum, but in the real world the crystal is made of atoms that are bound by forces governed by equations with continuous translational invariance, so when all processes are taken into account momentum must be conserved. Noether's Theorems are completely general and work for all physical systems derived from a Lagrangian principle. There are no extra assumptions such as that variables need to be separable.", 'username': 'Weburbia', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
