[31m124.171.32.15: This section seems off-topic from the overall article. It may be more suited to an article on occupational sexism, not airconditioning (i.e. Occupational sexism). rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mUdoks: I believe hiding it away would be denying the impact and trying to sweep such issues under the rug so to speak. This is a real issues impacting the lives of real women just as much as the proclaimed health impacts this impacts the mental health of women in the workplace. It's my case that this is highly relevant to Wikipedia. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mDeli nk: It's definitely not appropriate for this article.  I agree it's off topic.  The content is also based on low-quality sources with click-baity titles. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mUdoks: According to wikipedia's own allowance and their use in other sources they are more than reputable and in now way Click-Baitey titles. They are legitimate Wikipedia sources and such sites have been cited in a number of other articles including one recently cleared by Arbcom rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mDeli nk: Nonsense, Arbcom does not clear sources or articles. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mAndy Dingley: Why is an aspect very clearly focussed on aircon "inappropriate" here?  It is very well sourced, despite the doubly inaccurate "Completely based on the musings of one columnist in the Telegraph (not a reliable source on the subject)" claim. As to occupational sexism, then there is no reason why content can't appear in multiple locations. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mDeli nk: The claims that "air conditioning plays a large role in the inherent sexism and oppression of women in the workplace" and "overuse of airconditioning in offices is purely to benefit men" are ridiculous.  They are blatant exaggerations of what the crappy ''Washington Post'' and ''Telegraph'' articles say, and those two articles are themselves exaggerations of the primary source in ''Nature'' that only talks about "miscalculating metabolic rate on female thermal demand".  The whole thing is an unseemly inappropriate made-up controversy. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[36mAndy Dingley: So re-write it in a more neutral fashion. But we have four sources making much the same point, one primary and three commenting upon it.  Your "crappy" judgement is entirely OR. It is no reason to blank a whole section, just because you disagree with some conclusions drawn from it. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[35mVQuakr: This is completely off topic and sensationalistic as written. The linked general interest articles are about office temperature '''setpoints'''; whether the air is conditioned or naturally ventilated is not particularly relevant. Somehow that is being extrapolated into "air conditioning is inherently sexist." Devoting an ''entire freaking section'' to this stupid clickbait is moronic; a ''sentence'' somewhere summarizing the ASHRAE and Nature standards for the disparate comfort ranges for men and women would be appropriate as that appears to have been missing. rebuttal_labels:: DH0: Name calling/hostility, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mUdoks: Stupid Blickbait and moronic nonsense. I'm shocked you so flippantly dismiss the oppression of women by such systems and diminish those shedding light on such injustices like this. All the articles mentioned Air conditioning in some capacity and hiding the inherent sexism of this is just furthering peoples oppression. I posted on the talk page for this article over a week before I made edits. No-one cared then but suddenly it's like I've hit a nest of MRAs wanting to hide this information. How strange that suddenly so many people care about something others have already stated could be equally applicable here. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mUdoks: Nor are these sources breaking any of wikipedia's rules they are secondary sources and from a number of reputable publications rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mDeli nk: If you are using "OR" to refer to WP:OR, then you are not interpreting that page correctly.  My assessment of the ''Washington Post'' and ''Telegraph'' articles as crappy sensationalist nonsense is not WP:OR, it is my opinion of the quality of those sources.  Surely you can see that the editor that wrote "air conditioning plays a large role in the inherent sexism and oppression of women in the workplace" and "overuse of airconditioning in offices is purely to benefit men", which is nowhere included in the cited articles, was the one was adding their own original research into Wikipedia? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mVQuakr: MRA? Anyways, I joined the discussion when I became aware of it. As explained above, there is nothing "inherently sexist" about the subject of this article, air conditioning. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mUdoks: There is when people like you deny the real world impact it has on women's working lives. You're denying women of information and education about how the patriarchy is oppressing them every day. You're contributing to sexism by trying to help hide it or excuse it like this. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[35mVQuakr: I didn't deny anything, I explained it to you. Stop with the personal attacks, please. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[33mGeneral Ization: The discussion of someone's theory that the technology known as air conditioning has been abused by some male managers to oppress female workers (aside from the fact that it is itself sexist â€“ who's to say that some female managers haven't oppressed male workers in exactly the same way? Where are the statistics to show otherwise?) belongs in this article no more than the potential and frequent use of handguns and kitchen knives specifically as instruments of domestic abuse belongs in those articles (where it does not appear). Air conditioning is a '''technology''', just as those are '''implements''', and '''technology and implements can be used and abused'''.  It can just as easily be argued that companies that fail to provide air conditioning for their employees in hot and humid climates create unpleasant and inefficient work environments.  I can tell you this much: my wife does not feel the least bit oppressed by air conditioning systems at her work or at home.   '' '' rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument

[32mUdoks: Patriarchal oppression is core and present in so many aspects of modern life and only by making such things visible and easily seen can we stop the oppression of women. It is not coat racking as this is relevant and real to millions of womens lives in relation to this subject. Why do you presume to speak for all women? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[37m74.12.92.201: Please re-read the WP:COATRACK essay, specifically the section on "The Criticism Gambit". The problem is not with the significance of the material, but the fact that its relationship to the rest of the article is tenuous at best. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mVQuakr: Udoks, this is not the place to "explain the "truth" or "reality" of a current or historical political, religious, or moral issue." rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mUdoks: Except this is not some throw away issue. Sexism and patriarchal oppression permeates all aspects of our society and to reach true equality we me call these injustices out. This is not attaching some additional issue this is an issue relevant to all areas of society and denying women easily access to it just furthers their oppression. Is it not denying those trying to right a great wrong by denying them and their work a place on this page? Is it not documenting those wrongs being righting by documenting the existence of their work? These items were reported on mainstream press sites. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[33mGeneral Ization: If you haven't already, see WP:RIGHTGREATWRONGS.  And "these items" were speculated upon in lifestyle columns, not hard news articles, by commentators who, I suspect, had twinkles in their eyes when they wrote the articles. (You need, I think, a better sarcasm detector.  Ever watch Andy Rooney?) In any case, neither of these are investigative reporters, and they were engaged in edgy social commentary based on "research by walking around", not in investigative journalism.  Dvorak (whose article was basically just regurgitated by Lodi) even takes a playful poke at herself in her article ("Because weâ€™re doing top-notch investigative work here.").  Your attempt to portray either of these columns as hard evidence of ''anything'' is grossly misguided.  The only scientific sources are the ones mentioned by Sanghani, about different metabolic rates for men and women and errors commonly made in configuring climate control systems. But the studies she cites make no claims that this is all a product of some vast male conspiracy â€“ nor does Sanghani, other than her single use of the word "sexist" outside of the headline, by which she implies, perhaps correctly, that males are less impacted by this error than females due to their metabolisms.  It's a long way from there to an assertion, much less documented evidence (which is what we need here), of systemic abuse of female workers.
