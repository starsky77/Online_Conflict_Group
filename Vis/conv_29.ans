[31mTechnophant: Myofascial Meridians revived, NPOV rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mTechnophant: I've revived this discussion from archive. With the above arguments in consideration, as well as some new sources I've reworked long-standing and un-challenged content form myofascial meridians into this article in the section regarding research. It was awkward trying insert this into what looks like an very calculated and systemic attack on the fundamentals of TCM. Accordingly I added the the NPOV banner because there's no way this article in the way it sits now can be called neutral by community standards. - rebuttal_labels::

[34mAlexbrn: In the context of the mainstream, "myofascial meridians" appears to be a fringe concept with one mention only in a dodgy (chiropractic) journal, according to a PubMed search. If that is so, it is doubtful that Myofascial meridians should exist, and it would certainly be undue to mention it here.  || rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument

[36mMrBill3: Some clear specifics are needed to support an NPOV tag and discussion. This article is extensively discussed and worked out on this talk page. The content reflects well reviewed material based on evaluated sources. The article has been developed through extensive consensus building. An NPOV tag for the entire article based on a single editors vague assertion is not appropriate. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[36mMrBill3: Myofascial meridians and referred pain along such meridians as support for evidence of acupuncture meridians from a single researcher over five years ago without replication and recognition in academia is not a valid basis for content. Did Dorsher's 2009 publications lead to mainstream academia and medical science recognizing and accepting acupuncture meridians as having an anatomical basis? If so provide some sources that state that. The high quality sources that review the effectiveness of acupuncture that I have read all make reference to meridians as unsupported theory. One author getting published once in a reputable journal does not create the current medical understanding on a topic, especially if after five years there is no substantial validation. ''The Journal of Pain'' has published more on acupuncture since Dorsher's article and they don't seem reflect an acceptance of anatomical correlation. - - rebuttal_labels:: DH7: Refuting the central point
[36mMrBill3: To quote Pigliucci and Boudrey, "Asmaâ€™s example of Chinese medicineâ€™s claims about the existence of 'Qi' energy, channeled through the human body by way of 'meridians,' though, is a different matter. This sounds scientific, because it uses arcane jargon that gives the impression of articulating explanatory principles. But there is no way to test the existence of Qi and associated meridians, or to establish a viable research program based on those concepts, for the simple reason that talk of Qi and meridians only looks substantive, but it isnâ€™t even in the ballpark of an empirically verifiable theory." - - rebuttal_labels:: DH7: Refuting the central point

[31mTechnophant: @Mallexikon, here's a reliable secondary source (editorial control and fact checking) from the WSJ stating: "Many of the 365 acupuncture points correspond to nerve bundles or muscle trigger points. Several meridians track major arteries and nerves." That statement and source, with Dorser's Journal of Pain article cited for background and further info should be sufficient. It does not contradict the 2008 review being these are recent findings. - rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[33m2over0: The Wall Street Journal is a great source in general, but should not be used for medical claims per MEDRS. - rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[37mJayaguru-Shishya: I find WSJ far more reliable than blogs by different news sites. rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[31mSecond Quantization: You are missing the point. ''All news sites suck'' for medical claims and they are also shoddy for science claims (WSJ in particular). rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[37mJayaguru-Shishya: Blogs  are  being  used  as  a  source  in  other  alt  med  articles,  like  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic#cite_note-Brown2014-214 .  I'd like to see both discarded, but it is apparent that WSJ is more reliable than some ''blog'' in a newspaper. rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[31mSecond Quantization: No it does not follow. WSJ is garbage, but its possible that a blog could be much more reliable, particularly if written by a scientist blogging for example, WP:USERG:"''Some news outlets host interactive columns they call blogs, and these may be acceptable as sources so long as the writers are professional journalists or are professionals in the field on which they write and the blog is subject to the news outlet's full editorial control.''". But anyway, newspapers are not generally reliable for medical claims. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[35mBullRangifer: , you are failing to make a difference between MEDRS type content and non-MEDRS content. The sourcing rules are not the same. Brown's source is not used to support medical claims, but the opinions of a noted expert on the intersection between spirituality and chiropractic. That's actually a huge area, since chiropractic was created on the basis of a religious seance, and D.D. Palmer later (1911) considered making it a religion. Brown's comments have nothing to do with medical claims, so that content is not governed by the MEDRS guideline. MEDRS only covers medical claims, no matter which article at Wikipedia. It does not govern non-medical claims, even in medical articles. You have previously seemed to fail to understand this. I hope you understand it now so we don't have to continually explain it to you. It has also been explained to you that we don't deprecate a source just because its a blog. Blogs by experts and journalists are often used as RS here. So please stop your obsession with not using blogs since you clearly do not understand that issue either.

[31mTechnophant: A news source can be used to show that there's a debate. If language such as "According to the Wall Street Journal: Many of the 365 acupuncture points correspond to nerve bundles or muscle trigger points. Several meridians track major arteries and nerves." that should be acceptable. It doesn't make a clear medical claim, rather shows that other opinions exist. - rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mTechnophant: Abusing MEDRS to cover a minority scientific opinion does not comply with this directive: "1a) Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, a fundamental policy, '''requires''' fair representation of significant alternatives to scientific orthodoxy. Significant alternatives, in this case, refers to legitimate scientific disagreement, as opposed to pseudoscience."This guideline supports the general sourcing policy at Wikipedia:Verifiability with specific attention given to sources appropriate for the medical and health-related content in any type of article, including alternative medicine. Sources for all other types of contentâ€”including all non-medical information in medicine-related articlesâ€”are covered by the general guideline on identifying reliable sources rather than this specific guideline." Controversy among researchers, historical background, and opinions about acupuncture don't strictly fit the definition of "bio-medical information". - rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[33m2over0: Technophant, you misunderstand what is meant by "making a medical claim". Please reread the guideline. - rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
