[31mGraham Beards: Neutral point of view rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mCmguy777: The slavery section is controversial, and it should be neutral. I have been trying to get it neutral enough. The term "whippings" should be used in the article. Yes. We can do better. Washington made a fortune from slavery and land speculation. There is one catch with Washington, his 1799 abolition will. Washington may have had a conscious concerning slavery. In his will he freed all his slaves, after his wifes death, and gave them the right to remain in Virginia, not to be deported to some freedman's colony. His wife Martha freed his slaves in 1801. His money went into the care of taking care of his elderly freed slaves. Now this does not make up for the "whippings", the slavery, and profiteering. We should not "preach" to the reader, but rather just present the facts. How Washington felt is pure speculation. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mYopienso: I was ashamed an editor failed to accept your constructive criticism on the FAC and have urged him to reconsider. Ironically, I now find myself in the position of rejecting your criticism. I wholeheartedly agree the article isn't of a high enough quality to be designated a FA. I'm troubled by your approach here, however, on a subject you didn't mention on the FAC page: you assert, "This article comes across as an accolade to a racist." rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH3: Policing the discussion
[34mYopienso: I can't agree to writing this (or any) article from a presentist view. We may mention that some people today view Washington as a racist, because there is a trend in modern thought of applying that term in ways never imagined a few decades ago. Well and good, but ''Wikipedia'' follows current mainstream academic views. Ron Chernow, who represents the academic view, informed readers on p. 111 of his 2011 Pulitzer prize-winning biography, ''Washington: A Life,'' "However horrifying it seems to later generations, abominable behavior toward dark-skinned people was considered an acceptable way of life." On p. 6 he wrote, "George Washington entered a strictly hierarchical universe [...] As the economic basis of this undemocratic world, slavery was commonplace and unquestioned..." On p. 8, "Like her future husband, Martha Dandridge grew up in a world where slavery was taken for granted..."
While I'm utterly opposed to hagiographies, I can't agree to portray GW as a racist or a torturer. We should portray him in the context of the world in which he lived. This does a far greater service to our readers than a judgmental view applying 21st-century ideas to the actions of 18th-century people. Here are excerpts from an excellent essay, "Against Presentism," by Lynn Hunt:
Who isn't [against presentism], you say? Hardly any ism" these days has much of a scholarly following."
Over time, modernity became the standard of judgment against which most of the past, even the Western past, could be found wanting.
Presentism, at its worst, encourages a kind of moral complacency and self-congratulation. Interpreting the past in terms of present concerns usually leads us to find ourselves morally superior; the Greeks had slavery, even David Hume was a racist, and European women endorsed imperial ventures. Our forbears constantly fail to measure up to our present-day standards. This is not to say that any of these findings are irrelevant or that we should endorse an entirely relativist point of view. It is to say that we must question the stance of temporal superiority that is implicit in the Western (and now probably worldwide) historical discipline.
Respect for the past, with its concomitant humility, curiosity, and even wonder . . . enables us to see beyond our present-day concerns backward and forward at the same time.  					False

2	2018-06-30 07:42:19	Cmguy777	This is a talk page and editors should have some leeway on their own opinions as long as those opinions stay in the article. Yes. We should avoid presentism, but we should also avoid apologetics for slavery too. Chernow's opinion of Washington and slavery is not set in stone just because he won the Pulitzer. Chernow's ''dark-skinned'' quote is a bit dated and a generalization of African people. There were plenty of abolitionsists, Methodists and Baptists, in Washington's times and in his will Washington rejected slavery. Readers are free to judge Washington in any manner desired. Wikipedia is to present Washington as neutral as possible.  					False

4	2018-06-30 09:05:10	Yopienso	Certainly we shouldn't draw from or refer only to Chernow! He's a good source, though, and a good example of modern mainstream scholarship. Please read his chapter A Certain Species of Property" for an excellent example of even-handed narration that neither extols nor condemns. You're familiar with our deep bibliography.
Wrt "apologetics for slavery," I agree with Hunt: "Interpreting the past in terms of present concerns usually leads us to find ourselves morally superior." Imho, the main narrative should be as neutral as humanly possible, avoiding either a judgmental or an apologetic tone.
A "Historical reputation" section is valuable to show what people thought of Washington in his day, soon after his death, during the 19th and 20th centuries, and today. The task here is to find a reputable modern scholar who calls GW a racist who tortured slaves. And if you find one, we have to see how the academy has received her or him. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation

[36mGwillhickers: The slavery section was basically the same in terms of neutrality when the article was a FAC, yet none of the reviewers tagged the article for neutrality. There was not even a hint of any "accolade to a racist" during the review. Overnight one of the former reviewers tagged the article, and then removed it. Why wasn't the article tagged during the review? Simply because time wasn't taken to really read the article?? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mGwillhickers: Some of the above comments give us a clear reason why we need to present controversial issues in context. In the future, we should insist on reviewers who do not harbor such a flagrant bias and dislike against the subject. I was surprised to read GB's comments. In any case, no one denies that there's no improvements needed in any of the grammar, and the citations and sources are coming up to speed. It would be nice, btw, if as much attention was given to cites and sources (there are still a fair number that need attention) as is being given these highly opinionated issues. As for any apologetic tone, this seems to be aimed at anything that puts the issue of slavery in human context. Slavery was wrong, virtually everyone acknowledge that, but there were realities about simply releasing slaves, with no means of support, shelter, etc,  into "freedom". As for "racism", everyone was a "racist", and favored their own kind and culture, which is largely true today, esp in the old world. So it's almost funny when some refer to Washington as  some freak of society in this regard. Washington, like everyone else, was a product of his time, where family and national preservation came first. With common place war, infant mortality, disease, and a cruel and unforgiving world, civil rights issues barely existed then. Still, some struggled with the idea of slavery regardless. Unfortunately too many modern day TV viewers don't get that. Having said that, we say what the sources say, like it or not. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion, DH4: Stating your stance

[31mGraham Beards: This article suffers from American historical amnesia, (Google it).  American's have a view of history that is not shared by the world. (For example,  they did not win WW2, for that we needed the  Russians and  English Enigma code breakers.) As for "presentism" ,  the history of  the USA is shallow; my house, from which I am writing this, is older than the USA.   I would be ashamed to see a portrait of Washington on my money, and I suspect most African-Americans would agree with me.  We have a saying in the the UK that Americans think $100 is lot of money whereas the British think a hundred miles is a long way away. Please stop idolising  Washington; he was of his time, an astute militarian and politician.  He was not a nice person.  I do not like the way the article celebrates the man; his faults, which were many, need to be given equal weight. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mGwillhickers: Yes, we've acknowledged citation issues more times than I care to count and have been working on them all along â€“ and thanks so much for your revealing opinions. It's a little ironic that you were the one who initiated this section, entitled  ''Neutral point of view''. The "history of the USA is shallow"?? Really.. The American Revolution inspired revolutions around the world, starting with the French Revolution. Washington risked his very life, in many instances, (no big deal, huh?) to achieve independence from Britain. In many cases he suffered right along side his troops through harsh winters. He was fundamental in advancing a world premier government run by the people, not someone of "divine right". His ownership of slaves doesn't change these things one bit. We have an entire section on slavery, but you are welcomed to include any other "faults" that we may have overlooked, but I'm afraid this will require reading, time and effort on your part, and will also require citations from reliable sources. In any case, you obviously shouldn't have been a reviewer for this particular article. Where were these opinions when you made your initial review? We need neutral and objective assessments, not hostile and shortsighted views. Thanks for the experience. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH6: Refutation
[32mCmguy777: I hope we are not here to argue the merits of monarchy/democracy or the "divine right of Kings", and we can concentrate on George Washington. I will agree with Graham Beards. Washington was not a "nice person". The article should not celebrate slavery either. The subject of slavery goes back to the founding of the colonies. I believe the British Kings, or Queens, or Lord Protectors permitted the colonists to own Indian and African slaves. Were there slaves in England under the Roman Britain ? Even Isaac Newton may have invested in the slave trade in the West Indies. Many questions can be asked. Probably everyone back then was involved in the slave trade somehow. Washington was different, at the end. He set all his slaves free in his will, on condition of his wifes death, who set his slaves free in 1801. Washington also allowed his slaves to stay in Virginia, not be shipped to some freedman's colonies. That suggests Washington thought blacks and whites could live together as free persons. Slavery was/is a cruel institution. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mCmguy777: We are not here to discuss whether the "history of the USA is shallow" either, which is why divine right v democracy was mentioned. The section does not "celebrate" slavery. Where are you getting the notion that it does? Because we mention context? Also, most if not all the sources speak of Washington as a benevolent person, in spite of his faults. "Not a nice person"?  If you really need other leaders to put Washington in a proper perspective start with Stalin, Hitler, Pol-Pot, Genghis Khan, Saddam Husein â€” leaders that committed crimes against humanity far worse than slavery in America. Some young minds never survived the 60's and late 20th century evidently.
I am not trying to begrudge anything: but this is a good article: Slavery in the British and French Caribbean British slavery ended in 1833. Slavery in America, except a punishiment for (a) crime(s), was abolished in 1865.
These articles are good: Slavery in Britain, Slavery in the colonial United States, and Slavery in the United States.
Slavery was often times cruel, but more than often it was not. Fighting wars was ten times as cruel. Jefferson gives us a classic example of how slaves were well taken care of, worked no more than free farmers, allowed to raise their own chickens and produce, had Sundays, Christmas and Easter off, encouraged to attend church, and didn't do much in the late autumn and winter months, but were still well fed and provided for. Admittedly, Washington could have done better. In cities like Philadelphia, New York and Boston, Africans were taken in as house servants by mostly Christian families who detested slavery. These blacks were commonly referred to by other blacks as "house niggers". Abolitionist John Brown couldn't get a following of slaves because he couldn't convince them they would be better off following him. Most slaves didn't like slavery, (any more than dirt farmers didn't like their situation) but they weren't naive either. Activists and the 'friends of America' crowd don't want to tell you that part of the story for fear it will let a lot of hot air out of their socio-political balloons. Are we ready to get back to work and resume taking care of the real problems? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument

[32mCmguy777: Gwillhickers. We need to get concensus for George Washington to get FA. Graham Beards was one of the reviewers. "Slavery was often times cruel, but more than often it was not." does not help matters. Washington was not a "''nice guy''". He was a general and a plantation owner who drove the slaves to work. Whatever your views on slavery you have every right to have. But any personal views, including my own, on Washington and slavery should not hold up FA. Whipping slaves was the cruelty. Washington, for that matter, was the slaves King. The slaves had no rights, only privileges, at the mercy of their owners. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument

[36mGwillhickers: Given his last tirade against Washington and America, GB is out of the picture as far as objective reviewing is concerned. He seems to forget that it was Britain that was among the first to introduce slaves to the colonies. It was British shipping that was once at the center of the slave trade, while it was Britain who sold arms to the Confederacy during the Civil War all the while they were enjoying the fruits of slavery with the cotton they so desperately needed for their textile industry. And wasn't Britain once a young country? I can't believe he slighted a country for being young. Otoh, you don't help the article with your apparent refusal to acknowledge more than a 60's flat-earth assessment of slavery. We say what the sources say. No one has "idolized" Washington in the article. The section does not "celebrate" slavery in the slavery section. Please get a handle on these notions.  Washington sometimes had individual slaves whipped, but not in a frequency or in a manner you apparently would  have us believe, as such punishment was exceptional. Often the whippings were switching in the legs and hind quarters. Brutally whipping a slave to a bloody pulp for simply being idol would disable the slave from work, and of course create dissent among the other slaves and inspire more runaways big time. Think. There are very few accounts of such excess, let alone brutality. We need to keep presentist views out of the article and say what the sources say, which we've been doing all along. The sources say Washington frowned on excess. The only real problem is creating issues where none exist. Presentism. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
