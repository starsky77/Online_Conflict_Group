[31mAwien: Whatever the script calls for (and is that the actual shooting script that's quoted? where's the ref?), what she says is '''I''' was perfect. That's also the only thing that makes dramatic sense, given the what a powerful element her quest for perfection is throughout the film, and given her desire to emulate Beth whom she perceives as perfect. Also, there's another typo in what's quoted: her'''e''' eyes glaze over . . . rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mAwien: IMDb also has I was perfect: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/quotes rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mSubSeven: How would it not make just as much sense for Nina to say "it" (her performance) was perfect?
Here is a link to the script referenced above.
Obviously just listening to the scene is not so conclusive, as different people hear one thing or the other.  But watch her mouth as she's saying it, and it's pretty clear she's forming the word 'it'. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mAwien: You ask: How would it not make just as much sense for Nina to say "it" (her performance) was perfect? Because throughout she wants to '''be''' perfect, steals from Beth whom she wants to emulate because she '''is''' perfect.
As for the script, it's true that version calls for "it". But have you ever acted? Changes get made both accidentally and deliberately without the paper copy ever getting altered. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mDebresser: So far we have a script and at least my personal opinion that she said "It". I think that both versions make sense. But unless we would have proof or consensus otherwise, we should keep what we have. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mAwien: Some observations:
- That script was expressly prohibited to be performed, published, reproduced etc. etc. It appears to be pirated.
- It is by no means clear that it is the final version. We either don‚Äôt have or can‚Äôt see the colour-coded revisions mentioned at the beginning.
- Even if it was the final version, it could still have been changed during shooting.
- As far as I can see, everybody who blogged, commented, explained, quoted (inc. IMDb) on the basis of what they heard in the film percceived the last line as ‚ÄúI was perfect‚Äù.
- Sorry, but you are not a native speaker of English. I am. It makes a difference. I'm multilingual and a long-time language teacher, and I know. I hear "I".
- SubSeven had to force him/herself to hear "it" under the influence of the "script".
- Other people have tried before to correct the line to ‚ÄúI‚Äù.
- If the status quo is wrong, you change it. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mSubSeven: I didn't have to force myself to hear anything.  I saw the film in theaters, December 2010, and I heard "it was perfect".  This is only confirmed now when I re-watch the scene, and also by reading her lips during the scene.   And if that was not the case, and I did want to argue for a change, I would make sure I had something more substantial than original research. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mAwien: Absolutely take the quote out. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mBbb23: I don't care what the script says. I don't care what makes more sense dramatically. I also think that whether one is an English speaker or not is largely irrelevant; indeed, some non-English speakers are probably more tuned in than native speakers. And this business of I'm an expert and "I know" is frankly condescending. All that matters is what she said. At the moment, we have two editor who heard "it" and one who heard "I". Although consensus is not usually based on numbers, here numbers make some sense. So, leave it as "it". (In case any one cares, my preference would be to remove the quote from the plot completely and eliminate the need to spend this much energy on something so trivial. But, hey, this is Wikipedia, and that's not likely to happen.) ‚Äî Preceding unsigned comment added by   ‚Ä¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH4: Stating your stance
[34mDebresser: I am not in favor of taking the quote out, but wouldn't oppose it actively either. All your objects to "it" are not substantial, IMHO, but the reasons to keep it are. So either it stays "it", or the sentence gets removed, but "I" is out of the question. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mAwien: Debresser, you can't simply declare "I" to be out of the question. Setting aside what individuals perceive the word to be, we have documentation from two competing sources.
We have the quote as given by Internet Movie Database  which has the line as "I was perfect". IMDb is a high-profile and authoritative site, subject to a lot of scrutiny.
Then we have the pirated Moviecultists version of the script  but not at least SIX subsequent revisions mentioned right on the first page. [As a very obvious example of a difference between this script and the actual film, there's no mention of her being enveloped by the light, but that certainly happens]. There, the line is given as "It was perfect". So, not even the definitive script, coming from a not particularly authoritative source.
So unless you can back off from your excessive reliance on what is apparently only an early version of the script, and failing input from Portman or Aronofsky in person, I think we have to take the quote out. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mAwien: Have edited acknowledging both versions rather than removing the quote entirely. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mDebresser: And I have reverted you. Your edit was not discussed here, and I personally find it a bad idea. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mBbb23: I don't like the "compromise" either. Too much for too little and it's like airing our internal disagreement in public. When we have sources that conflict, sometimes we make note of that, but this is more a question of editors' hearing conflicting, and that's not something that belongs in the article. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[35mValidusername: IMDb (taken alone) is a dubious source of information in cases like this, since much of its "content is user-submitted and therefore not generally reliable" as per (essay) WP:IMDB.  „Äå„Äç rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mAwien: My compromise was a real compromise, not a "compromise": it even-handedly mentioned both versions.  Debresser, you need to support your claim that that's a bad idea. Bbb23, it's hardly "too much for too little" given that it's the climactic line of the movie. Both of you, if IMDb is not an acceptable source, Moviecultists is no more acceptable. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mAwien: But anyway, if compromise is unacceptable, we're left with delete. Bbb23, you already proposed it; Debresser, you "wouldn't oppose it actively"; on that basis, I will remove the quote later this evening unless enough people indicate that they prefer compromise after all. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mBbb23: I don't see any hurry to remove it. I think you should wait longer than that. For one thing, Debresser is against removing the quote; he just said he wouldn't "actively oppose" it, not quite the same. I'd like to hear from more editors before removing it. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mAwien: I'm going to try this again. There are incontrovertibly two views as to what the last sentence is. We could save a huge amount of time and effort by acknowledging that fact in half a dozen words added to the synopsis, and all move on. Yes? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mAwien: In the absence of disagreement, I am restoring an unbiased statement of the fact that opinion is divided as to what her last words are. If anyone doesn't regard this as a fair compromise and reasonable solution to the problem, I would suggest you refrain from reverting it until you discuss the matter here. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[36mBbb23: I've reverted you. Either you obtain a consensus for your change(s) (not temporary silences), or you can take the matter to WP:DRN. This is a small issue, although one that some feel strongly about (not I), and your impatience and tendency toward unilateral action are not helpful. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[36mBbb23: @Awien, you are headed for a block. I've warned you on your talk page. You are now at 3 reverts. I will not block you as I am involved, but I will report you if you continue. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
