[31mOlli Niemitalo: Google books survey rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mOlli Niemitalo: I had a look at the first 40 hits returned by a Google books search on '''"resource based economy"'''. It appears that the main definition contrasts resource-based economies with knowledge/human/service-based ones. The alternative definition is used in 4 books (10 %), 2 of which are by Fresco. That is very marginal especially concerning third parties, so the weight of the alternative definition in the article should be kept at a minimum and the article structuring/wording should not convey the impression that it is a majority definition. I don't think that the alternative definition should be completely removed, because it is still a borderline significant majority and a lot of people are probably going to be looking for that definition in particular. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mThe Banner: It is indeed interesting to see that the alternative use of the term is used by four books in the first 20 hits (5 in the top 40, based on the summaries). Still a Google Books search on ''"venus project" OR fresco OR zeitgeist "resource based economy"'' gives 297 books, 30 hits on Google Scholar and 7800000 hits on Google Search. Certainly not something to ignore. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mThe Banner: BTW: have you seen my new draft, mentioned just above here? rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mOlli Niemitalo: I saw your proposal, but I just wanted to share the survey results and be gone. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mEarl King Jr.: Okay, replaced "Economic model" by "economic theory/ideology". In fact, it is funny. I find thousands of links to Fresco/Venusproject/Zeitgeist-related items, but I can't find a definition of the "normal" use. Night of the Big Wind' From above.
As a reference to the articles ala what Night of the Big Wind is saying, their version is probably ok with the 'theory ideology' part adjustment. Its doubtful there is a 'normal use' because this article was crafted a certain way with the ''Resource-based economy'' phrase being spelled a certain way, the way Fresco 'invented' it, (according to Fresco http://thevenusproject.com/the-venus-project/resource-based-economy ) rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mThe Banner: The interesting thing is that what I called "the normal use" is mainly found in books and scientific articles. Fresco/Zeitgeist/Venus Project-type use is severely underrepresented there. But with Google Search it is just the other way round. I get the idea that the use related to producing and exporting raw materials is the oldest of the two, that is why I call it "normal use". But again, I am not an economist, just some fool trying to draft a new version to stop an editwar. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mOpenFuture: No, you are completely right. There is definitely a "normal" academic use of the term, and then a new use after The Venus Project got all the hype some years ago, with Fresco completely unrelated usage of the term. It is unfortunate that he started using this term in this completely misleading way, but it is an effect if hi also not being an economist and also have no clue what he is talking about. -) But it's nothing we can do anything to fix, utopianists are now talking left and right about a "Resource-based economy" and thinking it is something new and different, when it's just a new word for technocratic communism (and boy would I love it if some economist would actually write something about it). rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mEarl King Jr.: Its pretty much all based on this biophysical economics with a strong dose of this history . The original technocrats had nothing to do with Communism or Capitalism or Socialism etc which according to their information was not connected to resource based economics using an energy metric of value instead of money. Anyway that was the original meaning from the early 1930's, example link, rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mEarl King Jr.: I just found these two things http://technocracy.org/transition/economy/279-transition-doll and this http://conspiracies.skepticproject.com/articles/zeitgeist-addendum/ Is it worth using either? Steven Doll is or at least was a member of Venus Project and Technocracy group. Fresco an ex technocrat pretty much got the idea from Technocracy source. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mOpenFuture: I don't see how they can be labeled reliable sources for anything they say. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mEarl King Jr.: Steven Doll is or was a board member of Fresco's when he incorporated his ideas as Venus Project or 'Future' by design or what ever he calls it. He lives in Florida. He and Fresco are friends or so it seems. He was/is also a member of the main Technocracy group where he is an essay writer and thus an official speaker published by TechInc on their website. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mOpenFuture: Doesn't matter. See WP:RS. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mBiophily: To say that the Technocracy movement uses the term resource based economy is too severe of a generalization. The over-generalization is so glaring it is nearly erroneous. I don't understand how one could think that Fresco, would pick up the phrase from Doll (a very obscure technocrat by the way), who used the term only once in one article, the single and only article of Technocracy that ever used it, and then believe that Fresco would go on to based his entire ideology around this term. Good reason should suggest the contrary: Doll used Fresco's term. In fact, I have heard recordings from 1973 in which Fresco explains this term. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mEarl King Jr.: The term is a spinoff of biophysical economics, energy economics and has very little to nothing to do with original thinking of Fresco. Technocracy groups probably used it one way or another, the same ideas from 1918 on. Fresco got most of his information from Technocracy groups in the mid to late 1940's. He is a former member. Steven Doll helped Fresco incorporate his ideas Google or ''search'' 'Steven Doll Venus Project'. He is was or is integral to Fresco's setting up his group and he is still a part of it it looks like. Doll may seem obscure to you but he is a known published essay writer. From the tone of your post you sound almost angry about your opinions here. Take it easy. Its a controversial subject because of the groups in questions which have cult like followings. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[35mBiophily: Be sure, I'm not angry. The claim in the article just strikes me as misinformative. It's too much of a stretch. It is probably true that biophysical economics and a resource based economy represent the same idea. But there are no sources that state that, that I know of, and they are in fact two different terms that I feel no one here has the right to conflate. The article could be modified to be more specific about this issue. If it can be shown that the Technocracy movement used it much more often, or that biophysical economics is equivalent to a resource based economy by some source, then I would take no issue. If not, I recommend that the article be modified to reflect the limitedness of the fact in question. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mEarl King Jr.: Technocracy group in their official information advocate a resource based economy. Just because that is not repeated over and over does not matter. It is a part of their official information presentation on their official website http://surepost.com/igdtech/technocracy/eco1.php Accounting For Nature, by Steven Doll.
Much like the rest of the article where do you draw the line? Fresco uses the ''-'' to make resource'-'based economy, does the '-' make it a proprietary term? Something he invented? No. The people being discussed are apparent friends. What came first, the chicken or the egg and does it matter? It is a fact that Technocracy the ''group'' uses the term and it is currently a part of their information and it appears that some persons probably cross over between all the three groups mentioned though they are in no way affiliated with each other. As a former technocrat Fresco learned something while being involved with them probably. Probably the larger part of his philosophy comes from their material with different twists and turns. That is speculation but it looks that way. Just because Fresco and Zeitgeist have lots of redundant information on the same topic does not gain notability or importance. All it takes is one endorsement of an idea and published material on an official website that is current. Doll has published elsewhere. I think his full name is Steven L. Doll. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[35mBiophily: I suppose it's not worth much more push, but I look at it this way: Imagine if a communist of modest reputation used the term positively in one of his essays. Would it be right to say, "The Zeitgeist Movement and Technocracy Movement uses the term resource-based economy, as do the Communists" ? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mEarl King Jr.: That is probably a bad example because of the connection of the two groups personality wise. Fresco having gotten his basic ideas from ideas of energy accounting. No connection to your example, and the essay by Doll says ''Converting to a resource-based economy will require a monumental change in our thinking.'' since he is an official speaker to Technocracy Movement the citation is proof of using the term. That is pretty blatant. Energy accounting would be a resource based economy. That is a verifiable citation. That is what counts. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mOpenFuture: One person using the word "resource-based economy" in one article on a website does not mean that the whole movement can be said to use the term in any reasonable sense. If it would be on a Technocracy Movement FAQ, sure. If the article said "The aim of the Technocracy Movement is to reach a resource.based economy" or something like that, yes. But this is not the case here. This article is also the single article on that "Technocracy Research Library" page that uses the term. There is no basis for saying that the technocracy movement uses the term. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mEarl King Jr.: Wrong. That may be your opinion but you have your facts wrong. Its not just ''one'' website it is the official Technocracy website. It is not just one person, it is an official published essay writer for Technocracy. It says in black and white the same term and it is being used in the same way. The groups are historically connected though not literally connected. So, please stop removing information that is cited from the article. Even the other editor wanted to ''qualify'' the information not remove it  Removing a citation that proves a connection? Why? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[36mOpenFuture: Because it doesn't prove a connection. Even if it is an "official essay" (it's definitely not "published" in the normal sense of Wikipedia) this does not prove that the movement as a whole uses it regularly, In fact the complete absence of the term from other technocracy materials indicates that they don't. Including this material is original research. You are not a reliable source. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mEarl King Jr.: Wrong again. Its published Published in: The Northwest Technocrat, 4th quarter 1994, No. 337. That means it goes out to libraries and other readership just like any other piece of information from an organization. It mentions the term ''resource-based economy'' It uses the term. What do you mean by regularly? Why remove the information when it can be qualified? The other editor qualified it, not removed it. You did not answer those questions. What do you mean by ''You are not a reliable source?''. What has that got to do with anything? Why are you calling ''me'' not a reliable source? Your commenting on ''me'' and not the issue which is the source and citation and the wording and the connection. It says that the Technocracy movement ''uses the term''. It is documented that they use the term. The criteria is not whether the ''whole movement'' which is very nebulous says it but the official information says it, published it and has stuck with that information to the current time. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation, DH3: Policing the discussion
[36mOpenFuture: Not exactly a peer-reviewed journal is it? -) But, OK let's not argue about the definition of "published". It's practically irrelevant anyway, as the source does not claim that the Technocracy Movement uses the term. It is one article, by one person in the technocracy movement. Claiming that therefore "The Technocracy Movement" uses the term is not supported by that source.
'"It is documented that they use the term."'' - No, it is not.
'"the official information says it"'' - No, it does not. An article by a person in the movement is not "official information". An offical FAQ would be official information. By your logic, if say, The Rand Institute published an article where they discuss TZM / TVP and how resource-based economy is just another word for utopian techocratic communist (I can dream, can't I?) you could then claim that Rand "uses the term" which either is absurd, or reduces the meaning of "uses" to meaninglessness.
To claim that the technocracy movement uses the term, you have to have either a source that they do use it, or you need to show that they do so in "official information" or at least that the term is pervasive within the movement.
Once again: One article, by one person does not a movement make. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[36mOpenFuture: And since I don't want to edit war about it, and since I don't want to escalate this sort of ridiculous nonsense, please self-revert. rebuttal_labels:: DH-1: Bailing out, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
