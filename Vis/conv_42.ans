[31mN-HH: How about keeping it, but moving it to the "related topics" section rather than retaining it as a confirmed anarchist "school of thought"? Also, on the related issue of "National Anarchism", I support removing that altogether. While anarcho-capitalism has some purchase as an ideology, at least in the US, and undoubtedly has links to anarchism proper, that seems to be just an utterly fringe far-right thing which no connection whatsoever to anarchism as commonly understood.

[32mKnight of BAAWA: No. Anarchocapitalism is a confirmed anarchist school of thought despite what the haters, e.g. those like Eduen who use scarce-quotes, want to believe. It belongs in the list of schools of thought. - rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mInterrexconsul: Anarcho-capitalism is only a 'confirmed' school of anarchist thought by its own adherents. No sources that discuss anarchism in general refer to it as a legitimate branch of anarchism other than perhaps to dismiss it. I agree it does belong in the 'issues' section, but not as a coherent school of anarchist thought. Knight of BAAWA apparently wants to promote Ancap-ism since it seems to be a topic of interest to them, but that does not increase its status as being a notable branch of anarchist thought. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36m24.197.253.43: This is what I propose; and indeed it is already there under "Issues". rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mKnight of BAAWA: So the Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought dismisses it? Hmmmm. No. Or its Encyclopedia of Political Thought? Nope. Please don't just make up things when we can find the sources which show that you're wrong. - rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mInterrexconsul: You really seem to have a heavy emotional investment in this issue. I'm not sure if the attitude you're looking at this with is constructive. And I never contended that the sources you list dismiss it as an ideology, merely that they don't align its belief system with anarchism as a whole. Lastly, nobody can be right or "wrong" as you described in as far as what ideology is part of a school of thought. You are clearly coming at this with a biased POV. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Repeated argument
[35mFreeKnowledgeCreator: I agree with Knight of BAAWA; there is no reason to remove anarcho-capitalism from the template simply to satisfy those who dislike or disagree with it being characterized as a form of anarchism. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[33mMalik Shabazz: I feel strongly that the template should include a link to Anarcho-capitalism, and I don't particularly like the idea that new or unpopular anarchist movements should be kicked off the template or moved to another section. What's next: should we debate whether one can be an anarchist and follow a religion (bye, bye, Christian anarchism) or whether former black nationalists can really be anarchists (bye, bye, Black anarchism). I look forward to the bloodletting. â€”Â Â / rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mInterrexconsul: The issue is that there is more to it than 'unpopularity', while Anarcho-capitalism is undoubtedly that amongst anarchists, the relevant issue is that the only group that purports it to be an actual school of anarchist thought are an-caps, not outside scholarly sources. It can certainly be linked as a relevant issue, but to include it as being a school of thought would be akin to include National Socialism as being a school of thought of Socialism simply because retains the same part of the name and it supports a strong centralized state. Anyone educated about the two philosophies would agree that while the two do share a handful of traits in the broadest of strokes, to claim they are related ideologies would be silly. The same goes for anarcho-capitalism and anarchism. While anarchism and anarcho-capitalism both share the trait of wanting to dissolve/minimize the state, the similarities end there. Anarchists of every other stripe believe in dissolving hierarchies and private property, while anarcho-capitalists believe in one or both of the two (depending on whose interpretation to which you subscribe). The philosophies simply aren't particularly related other than the controversy over whether they are. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mN-HH: The problems with anarcho-capitalism and "national anarchism", the latter especially, are more fundamental than people not liking them or being "new". This is a debate about classification, not about the â€“ to be frank, slightly odd-sounding â€“ refrain about "hate" that keeps coming up (for info, you're not doing a very good job of selling anarcho-capitalism). People can assert on WP talk pages that ancap is definitively anarchism, but that is simply not what the record says. Yes, it is sometimes bracketed with it, but there is always nuance or even uncertainty and disagreement on the point, and WP needs to reflect that. Even the Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought, mentioned above in favour of the ancap-as-anarchism claim but not actually quoted from, describes it as "a tendency in the libertarian New Right", which as it happens is also "largely confined to the US" with "minimal" influence. Other sources are cited in this section of the ancap page, including Peter Marshall's ''A History of Anarchism'' â€“ described by one newspaper reviewer as "the most comprehensive account of anarchist thought ever undertaken" â€“ which has a small chapter on it but concludes that "few anarchists" would accept anarcho-capitalists as anarchists and that they might "best be called right-wing libertartians rather than anarchists". Even Murray Rothbard himself is quoted in that section disavowing the anarchist label, saying, per this piece: "We must therefore conclude that we are ''not'' anarchists, and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground, and are being completely unhistorical". Also, @FreeKnowledgeCreator, the point of the proposal or compromise â€“ hence why I described it in those terms â€“ was not to remove it from the template but, as I explicitly said, to retain it but move it.

[32mKnight of BAAWA: Yes, we get into No True Scotsman if we kick out the "unpopular". The decision was made long ago to embrace all the forms of anarchismand that is a decision I agree with. Wikipedia isn't about popularity; it's about verifiability, facts, and vetted sources. - rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mKnight of BAAWA: Rather it is those who hate anarchocapitalism who are emotionally invested; I'm simply trying to help keep them from editing in bad faith and marginalizing a valid school of anarchism. - rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[37mEduen: I have been editing anarchism related articles for some years now and i donÂ´t know what decision to "embraces all forms of anarchism" user Knight of BAAWA is talking about. It seems from what i read here that there is no consensus to keep anarchocapitalism in the schools of thought section of this template. I already gave my reasons before for not incluiding that thing here. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm? And that's just ONE example, Eduen. Just one example. All one has to do is check the archives for this page and the main anarchism page.
