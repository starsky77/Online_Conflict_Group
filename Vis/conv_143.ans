[31m130.105.196.215: Editorializing
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Somali_Civil_War&diff;=751693393&oldid;=751392683
I must protest the insistence some have on editorializing. I did not question the alleged truth of the idea that the UN has authority, I questioned the idea's objectivity. Because the removal of editorializing was marked as unexplained, I had to explain it as removing editorializing.
As you can see, I've already been through this with Buckshot06. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mCordless Larry: Can you please explain what you see as editorialising? Things like replacing "central authority" with "State" (why the capital S) don't seem to be about removing editorialising to me. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34m130.105.212.112: This is going to be a long post. You did ask for an explanation, after all.
I hope this is an answer to your question: maybe editorializing is not the thing wrong with "Things like replacing "central authority" with 'State'", but a Wikipedia article content page is still definitely a wrong venue for taking sides. Calling it an "authority" means that it has the right to do what it's doing, and if it's abused and exceeded its authority, then that's an abuse that somehow isn't really an abuse. Whichever of multiple similar rules apply here, the rule or rules definitely forbid using judgemental language. For example, you might as well call Siad Barre's administration "the heroes" as call them "the villains" or "the regime", and you might as well call UNOSOM "the rescuers", "the war machine" or "the foreign interlopers" as call a State "the authorities" or "central authority". It's a package deal - once you allow an administration to be called a "regime", or a State to be called an "authority", central or otherwise, so many people will so passionately try to put their POV in there, you might as well just lock any page that says anything about politics or the State so only admins can edit it. So Barre's administration is called nothing more or less than that - his administration. It's not as if you can't have your opinion about his administration, and it's not as if there aren't public venues where you may express that opinion to an audience. I have an opinion about it too - which is why I don't have to be reminded of it.
Another thing going on here is that  seems to be treating accuracy as the same thing as objectivity, as if all truths were objectively true. I am not sure that he knows I questioned only the alleged objectivity of the statement that the UN gave authority to the troop movements to take place, rather than the alleged truth of the statement. I tried explaining it to him at length, and as I post this, he has not yet responded. This will be what passes for clear upon visiting the section of the talk page I sent you.
This is going to be a long, caffeinated, meandering explanation the length, caffeination, and meandering of which and its presence in a conversation in which so far people have had an unexpected and severe difficulty in communicating with each other necessitates an explicit, kind of bizarre but, on its own terms, quite logical writing style. Where applicable, the explanation's information structure is given a rudimentary, explicit marking with the "[FOCUS] f" syntax. Consider the all-caps text in the square brackets followed with the sub-scripted letter FOXTROT to be in focus. Otherwise, consider the text in those of the square brackets that do not make the contents into a link, to be the nonce attitudinal.
[The following sentence [ESTABLISHES THE REASON WHY WHAT'S LEFT OF THE EXPLANATION IS BEING MADE] f.] You also asked about the reason for the upper case letter Sierra.
[The following sentence [IS THE THESIS] f.] The reason [IS CLARITY] f.
[The following paragraph [IS A SUPPORTING ARGUMENT FOR THE THESIS] f.] [WHEN THE FIRST LETTER IN A SENTENCE IS LOWER CASE, WHEN THE WORD "State" IS AT THE FRONT OF A SENTENCE, AND WHEN ALL THE LETTERS ARE UPPER CASE] f, the word "State" is ambiguous. It could have the meaning often shared by words such as ["STATUS" AND "CONDITION", OR IT COULD MEAN "A SINGLE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT", BY WHICH WIKIPEDIA DOES NOT MEAN "ADMINISTRATION"] f. This is opaque in English because [IN AMERICAN ENGLISH, THE WORD "GOVERNMENT" MEANS 'State', BUT IN OTHER DIALECTS OF ENGLISH, THE WORD "GOVERNMENT" MEANS "ADMINISTRATION"] f . For an example of the State-administration distinction, when Tony Blair left office, his administration ended, but not because of any armed insurgency that would have taken the countryside and cities that aren't London by force of arms. But Barre's State ended because he was no longer hypocritical enough to sustain the clan loyalty he exhibited that kept him loyal to his power base despite making clan loyalty illegal, but more relevantly his State ended because his power base retaliated against his State by no longer being his power base and by coming to support one or more of the active armed insurgencies that took the countryside, and ultimately the country, by force of arms. But when the first letter in the word "State" is upper case and the other letters in the word are lower case and the word is not the first one in the sentence, then it is much more likely to mean the latter.
[The following paragraph [IS WHERE THE EXPLANATION MEANDERS IN EARNEST, BY BEING NOT STRICTLY RELEVANT] f.] In English, this kind of opacity and complexity is routine, [BUT IN ESPERANTO, THIS PROBLEM IS RARE BUT DOES HAPPEN] f. For example, the meaning "status" and "condition" share with "state" [IS DENOTED BY "STATO"] f, but the latter meaning [IS DENOTED BY "REGISTARO" OR "ÅœTATO"] f. The little hat on the letter Sierra [MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE] f.
[The following sentence [IS THE CONCLUSION AND IS MEANT HALF-SERIOUSLY, AND HALF-INDIFFERENTLY TO WHETHER IT IS FUNNY, NOW THAT THE "COST DRIVERS" SPEECH, WHICH HAS A SIMILAR ENDING, WAS MADE] f.] Was that [CLEAR] f, or would you like [FOR ME TO TRY AGAIN] f? rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mCordless Larry: You appear to be confusing two meanings of the word "authority", IP editor. As for your explanation of the capitalisation of state, I'm afraid I don't understand what you are trying to argue. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36m130.105.197.204: I don't get it. Which two meanings? As for my explanation of the capitalisation of "state", which part do you want for me to clarify and why was it unclear? rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mCordless Larry: If you follow the link I gave to a dictionary, you'll see "the moral or legal right or ability to control" and "a group of people with official responsibility for a particular area of activity". Regarding the capitalisation of state, I didn't get any of your explanation. I don't see anything in Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters that suggests that it should be capitalised. rebuttal_labels:: 
[35m130.105.213.181: About the two meanings: I misread the page and assumed that there were more than two meanings. I didn't really agree with the definition. The problem is partly with lexical definitions, such as what you'd find in the dictionary. I prefer theoretical definitions, such as in encyclopedias, textbooks, or some sort of simulation. But to accept both that the definition is lexical and to further accept the content of the definition "as it were", when you call someone or something an authority or the authorities, that is the same thing as saying they have authority. When you call a State by the word for "a group of people with official responsibility for a particular area of activity", it is editorializing or POV or something because it calls the State a group of people with official responsibility for a particular area of activity. In the dictionary, it's two entries with two different wordings, but in practice in cases like this, "official responsibility" is the same thing as "the moral or legal right or ability to control". The statement that the State has official responsibility materially implies the statement that the State has the moral or legal right or ability to control. Neither the antecedent nor the consequent in that material implication have any place on Wikipedia, whether it's because of WP:TRUTH, WP:POV, or WP:EDITORIALIZING or anything else. The dictionary defined it like so: rebuttal_labels::
