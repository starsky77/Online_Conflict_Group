[31mAigest: And the point of the article is? rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mAigest: Practically not a single English source even for the (pompous) name and a clear WP:FORK of Serbia in the Balkan Wars. Also is way to far in WP:OR territory. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mAntidiskriminator: You maybe did not notice the recommendation left by uninvolved editor who is also administrator. I will repeat it to you: ''"At this point, I recommend that anyone who still believes that this is a POVFORK take it to AfD."'' Therefore I will remove tags you added into this article without presenting any source which dispute any information presented in this article. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mZjarriRrethues: I have mentioned in the previous section too many times that the title is your translation, which is nowhere to be found in English-language sources so could you please reply without WP:IDHT to my comment?¬† rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mAntidiskriminator: This was reply to Aigest's comment. If you believe that this article should be renamed, there is a procedure for that. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mZjarriRrethues: Are you saying that you're even going to reply to my comment about you using a translation about the subject that exists only on-wiki?¬† rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mAntidiskriminator: The existence of the subject of this article is supported by numerous sources I presented. I did reply to your comment. Let me paraphrase it if it was not understandable: If you think my translation is wrong and if you believe there is better translation and if you believe that this article should be renamed you are free to follow the procedure for renaming the article. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[36mQwyrxian: Only warning, Antidiskriminator: you're being tendentious and failing to actually engage in the dispute.  Rather than address the concern that your particular translation is OR, you're ignoring the issue and placing the burden unfairly on others.  If you continue to game the discussion rather than actually justifying your actions (for example, why you chose the translation you did), I will block you under the WP:ARBMAC). rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[36mQwyrxian: And I should clarify my earlier comment: when I recommended taking this to AfD, I didn't mean to say that that was the only option now available to editors who disagree with the article.  I made that statement because 7 days had passed with no discussion.  If editors are willing to discuss the issue here, then they should do so.  There will not be edit warring over the tags.  I still believe that an AfD may be the appropriate choice, but it's not the only one, as it depends on the exact complaint.  ZjarriRrethues, are you suggesting that the article simply needs to be renamed, or are you, like Argeist, suggesting this is an unsavable POVFORK/OR? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mAntidiskriminator: I thought that it was obvious that I translated the subject of the article the best I could.
The name of this administrative unit on Serbian language is Draƒçki Okrug. There are two words. Draƒç and okrug. Draƒç is name of Durres on Serbian language. Okrug means county on english language. I think that I did not make mistake when I translated it to county because if you go to google translate it gives two alternative translations of serbian word okrug to english language: district and county. Therefore the translation of name on serbian language Draƒçki okrug is County of Durres or District of Durres. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mAntidiskriminator: I followed the practise of another article about administrative divisions in Serbia. Subdivisions of Nediƒá's Serbia. It clearly says:'' The country was divided into counties () and districts ()''. I could not use district as name because this administrative unit already had four districts (srez). Therefore I used county as name. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mZjarriRrethues: (unindent)The article should firstly be moved to Durr√´s okrug and then we can step-by-step deal with the rest. The meanings of the work okrug vary from district to department and as there's not any English-language source about it, use the term okrug as many other articles do. Btw while you're translating srez as district, Google Translate translates it as county etc. The infobox, which was added by Antid., removed by Majuru and finally reverted by Antid. when you fully protected the article uses the 2004-2010 Coat of Arms of the Republic of Serbia as the coat of arms of a ..1912 entity. Even if it resembles the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Serbia it'd still be wrong to use it. That being said the Coat of Arms was probably that of the royal family, but obviously they didn't use it as the CoA of every single province of their state.¬† rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[32mAntidiskriminator: Let us focus on the translation issue in this section.
I already explained that I did not make mistake when translating to English language and I explained what was the practice with administrative units of Serbia from that period. Will you please why do you think we should rename this article to Durres okrug? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mZjarriRrethues: The editors, who wrote Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia may also think that their translation ''district'' is the right one but Antid. I've been asking for English language sources that say that this entity in Durr√´s was called a county and instead of providing that source you're not even trying to find it.¬† rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mAntidiskriminator: I already explained that I did not use sources on English language, but translated the name to English language the best I could, having in mind the current practice. I don't have any source on English language for the translation of name of this administrative unit to English language. Not for the County of Durres, nor District of Durres nor Durres Okrug or any other name on English. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mZjarriRrethues: Don't you think that we should stick to the sources and not translate them as we see best? Many articles in wikipedia are titled X Okrug.¬† rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mAntidiskriminator: I don't agree. I already explained why I did use that translation and what is the current practice with administrative units of Serbia from those days. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[36mQwyrxian: Regarding the correct translation of okrug, if, in fact there is "one" translation, and therefore the title of this article, either a  Requested Move or an Request for comment are probably the best way to go. Things you'll want to account for are the name we use for current and historical administrative subdivisions of Serbia (see Districts of Serbia and Subdivisions of Nediƒá's Serbia), other information about Okrug, and our policies on WP:Article titles and verifiability.  However, ZjarriRreuthues, if you eventually plan to argue that the article should be deleted, you may simply want to ignore this and move to a deletion discussion (no reason to have a big discussion about the article title if the underlying article isn't going to survive).  Note that I have absolutely no opinion about the name, translation, or suitability of the article itself. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mAigest: During the Balkan wars, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Serbia conquered many Ottoman territories. In every single village occupied usually there were journal reports of crowds cheering, welcoming etc (big deal!). Up to the moment where political borders were decided by London Treaty the regions occupied were under military rule, as usual. And this situation lasted only for a couple of months, while occupying troops retreated to their respective countries. Now imagine articles for every single small region shortly and very temporarily occupied in every war. That makes nonsense since usually A. it doesn't fulfill notability issues and B. the content is usually content fork of other articles, (in this case Albania during the Balkan Wars and Serbia in the Balkan Wars) C. it leads to POV issues and disputes and we can add a D. in this case being an WP:OR. If you find any interesting info on that issue just merge it to the above mentioned articles. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mAntidiskriminator: ''A''', the article about this administrative unit fulfills the notability issues because there are numerous sources about it. '''B''', the article about this administrative unit is article about administrative unit which existed and is not fork because there are no other articles about this administrative unit '''C''' I don't agree that the article about this administrative unit necessarily lead to POV issues and disputes. '''D''' This article is not OR because every information presented in this article is supported with referenced sources. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mAigest: Let me see:'''A''' Wikipedia:Notability ''"Significant coverage" means that sources address the subject directly in detail, so no original research is needed to extract the content.'' Practically every single sentence in the article points to different references varying from 1922 to 2010 magazines and newspapers and this constitutes WP:SYNTH and WP:OR. Now which peer reviewed source address the subject Durres county(?!) directly in detail? Apparently there is none. Moreover you get no google hits on that topic except wiki source. '''B''' As itself is not notable (you have no story to tell Antid) the article is clearly a fork content of Albania during the Balkan Wars and Serbia in the Balkan Wars. If you think that such generic sentences as "the Serbian troops were welcomed" "they appointed local governors and "they retreated" deserve to be in another article separated from Albania during the Balkan Wars and Serbia in the Balkan Wars than you have no idea of what fork content is for. As for '''C''' POV issues we have 1922 Serbian newspapers variant vs International Committee investigations (see Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars) and that is just one point. '''D''' is explained above. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mAntidiskriminator: This administrative unit existed and deserves its article. I presented numerous sources which directly mention this county which prove it existed. I already provided numerous sources and quotations and explained on this talk page that there are sources covering the subject in details. This is an article about administrative unit. There are no other articles about this administrative unit in wikipedia. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mAntidiskriminator: Qwyrxian, will you please be so kind to explain me what should I do now in order to avoid being blocked? rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mQwyrxian: Right now you're fine, Antidiskrimnator; I appreciate you answering the questions addressed here.  Of course, there's still disagreement.  Aigest, if you think the article should be deleted, you're going to have to nominate it for deletion on the grounds you listed. The issue is clearly contentious enough to need an WP:AfD; if you don't know how to set that up, let me know and I will assist.  If you don't wish to pursue that, and want to pursue a merge or something else, there are processes for that, too.  If you don't want to pursue those options, but just want to change the article text, perhaps an RfC is in order (if you can specifically frame what needs to be changed).  Once you indicate whether or not you want to AfD, then we can reconsider the naming issue that ZjarriRrethues raised. rebuttal_labels::
