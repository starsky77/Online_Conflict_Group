[31m166.205.136.246: Formal Theorem rebuttal_labels:: 
[31m166.205.136.246: It was obvious from the preceding discussion that two articles (one clearly a POV fork) were not needed so I have redirected Formal Theorem here.  If after further discussion and consensus it's determined that there is material in Formal Theorem not adequately covered here with due weight, it can be added to this article. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mGregbard: This anonymous editor is unclear on the difference between POV and WEIGHT. It would be helpful is he identified himself so we can address any POV issues that he may manifesting historically. I suspect that is why he is choosing to be anonymous. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mGregbard: As for the claim of POV itself, all of the content of formal theorem is objectively stated subject matter. If there are any particular statements which we could address rather than a blanket characterization, that would be helpful. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34m166.205.138.83: Fine, back as it was rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mGregbard: The group has had a year to find a mutually acceptable way to integrate the content in a merge. So far, they demonstrated no inclination or competence in doing so. Separating the content portrays more POV than integrating it for reasons I pointed out at WT:MATH. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mArthur Rubin: The "merge" now performed is still not acceptable.  The articles are about different, but related, concepts.  I've attempted to revert the merge, but I'm not sure I've done it correctly.  â€” rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mGregbard: Um yeah, Arthur, clearly they are not two different concepts. I think you are going off the deep end with that claim. There is no reasonable claim that a theorem, and a theorem expressed in formal language are different concepts because the whole point is that we are able to express the same concept informally and formally. Face it Arthur, this is a genuine case of you POV getting in the way of you seeing reality. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[36mArthur Rubin: On the contrary, they clearly '''are''' two different concepts, if we can agree and what "are" means.  On the other hand, they are fairly well related, so a single article would be acceptable, '''if''' "formalism" is minimized in what was previously in theorem before the merge.  (Aside from problems with infinitary logic and proofs, which doesn't seem to be anywhere in the article at the moment, as they weren't there before the merge.  They ''should'' be there.)  â€” rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mGregbard: No, not on the contrary. You are confusing the fact that there are different senses of a term, and two different concepts. It absolutely is you and the the others who are imposing POV, whereas I am covering the same concept from different methodology, which is how articles become comprehensive. You really are off base here Arthur, and it really is your POV that is blinding you to that fact. I don't know how you would minimize the coverage more than placing it below "lore" and the other junk. the section itself is quite concise. Be well, rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
