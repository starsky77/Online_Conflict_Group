{'text': 'There has never been a guideline that defines the number of episodes required for recurring status, and for good reason. Technically, only two episodes are required to make a character recurring. If a guest star appears in the same role twice they are technically a recurring character. If they appear twice but in different roles they are a recurring actor. However, if an actor appears as the same character 3 times across a series run, in different seasons, that\'s not necessarily a recurring role. On the other hand, if they appear 3 times within a season, that is normally recurring. And then you have characters like "Althea" from \'\'The Big Bang Theory\'\' who is portrayed by the same actress and is always a nurse but appears in different situaations each time. She has been in 6 episode, including the unaired pilot, always in different seasons and yet is classed as a recurring character. We don\'t fix the number of episodes because it can\'t be applied consistently. That\'s the way it has always been. Note also that an actor be credited as a guest but appear in a recurring role and when an actor appears in 3 episodes in one season and then promoted to a starring role in the next, that\'s definitely a recurring role.', 'username': 'AussieLegend', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}

In fact, there is a substantial opinion on WP:TV that 4–6 episodes should be needed to be considered recurring, which you should be aware of if you\'ve been participating in these discussion for "years". I myself have seen more than one discussion on this, and there is pretty much always a contingent of WP:TV editors in these discussions that wants to see 4, 5 or 6 episodes used as the benchmark for recurring.   •', 'username': 'IJBall', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH4: Repeated argument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'I think three episode appearances should be considered guest starring. We have a huge number of actors who appeared in three episodes in a season in various shows.

{'text': "I'm having a little trouble understanding how my opinion isn't supported by WP:TVCAST. The guideline about two or three appearances does not necessarily mean a recurring role is very vague.  That means it could be a recurring role but also may not be a recurring role. Which is why I thought it turned around and mentioned sources. Which is where it says if sources can't adequately distinguish consensus should determine. So all I'm trying to do is follow the guidelines.
