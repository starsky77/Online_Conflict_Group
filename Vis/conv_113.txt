{'text': "Hi.  I was just stopping by, saw the tag, and thought I would offer an evaluation.  In the Vice Presidency section, I count three paragraphs detailing Quayle's gaffes, two more on the Murphy Brown speech (which was not a gaffe and is not presented as one; note the supporting quote from Bergen herself), and three short paragraphs at the beginning describing other aspects of his Vice Presidency.  The article overall has something like 20 paragraphs (that's an estimate, not a count).\nMy judgment is that the three paragraphs on gaffes are appropriate.  All of the items listed are well-known, and an article on Quayle would be incomplete without them.  If you are concerned about WP:UNDUE weight, then I would suggest you add more material about other things he did as Vice President.   /", 'username': 'BlueMoonlet', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH7: Refuting the central point'], 'coordination_labels': []}

{'text': 'I agree that the section of this article describing gaffes is accurate and appropriate as written, and may even understate the issue.  The events cited are well known facts, and many additional incidents took place that are not cited.  Removal of any part of the present article would be distorting truth.  Dan Quayle’s intelligence and competence to serve were serious issues to many Americans in the 1992 election, including many in his own party.  This was among the primary factors attributed to the Bush administration’s failure to win re-election.
