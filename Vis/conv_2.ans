[32mWikiscribe: there is no reason there should be anymore pics in this artcile its an enyclopedia article not a picture book
there are maybe 30 pics in the gallery already to give a broad spectrum of examples rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mUsergreatpower: Well you may want to go check some other articles then because I see plently of photos on other articles. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mUsergreatpower: There is no reason why 2 example photos should not be included in 2 relevent sections on this article. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mUsergreatpower: Can you explain why the Black people article has example photos in relevent sections through the article or why articles such as the United States have pictures through the article instead of just a gallery at the end if Wikipedia isn't supposed to be a 'picture book' as you put it? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mUsergreatpower: I was told to gain consensus before editing this article yet I am the only one using this talk page. Consensus is merely an excuse for blocking edits, as the people reverting edits state gain consensus first and won't attempt to build any consensus as they won't use the talk page while the article is their version, only if they are trying to put it back to their version. I also feel these reverst are racially motivated judging by the editors contributions histories. I will take this to the Admin notice board as I feel there is a racist few here restricting improvement of this article. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mRamdrake: First of all, it would be nice if you actually ''gave'' people time to reply, say a day or two at a minimum, rather than minutes. The sunbject of the pictures has actually been raised more than once on the talk page and the associated archive. In every case, it was decided by consensus not to have images in the article. For the record, I still think it's a bad idea: we already have the image gallery whih does just that. And please spare us the epithets: I would think just the scope of the gallery should demonstrate that no one here is racist. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mUsergreatpower: However I think it's very poor that I need to take it to the Admins noticeboard to get any response. People seem to have the idea that this is their article and their say goes and any attempt by an outsider to change it from their preference will be responded to with reverts and these outsiders do not deserve any discussion. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mWikiscribe: Just for the record of consenus building i am against adding anymore pics whether it is to the gallery or to random parts of the article also just to let you know the black people article had no gallery for the longest time whilst this article had a gallery , this is not a compeition of dueling articles because one has the other should as well that is ridiclous rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[31mUsergreatpower: So here's the main point, is a photo of Marylin Monroe in the Physical appearance section a good or bad idea? I feel it's a good idea because she's probably the most iconic example of an idealised appearance of a white person. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mWikiscribe: okay thats fine lets give it a few days and see what some other editors think rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mRamdrake: Previous consensus was against the inclusion of a sterotypical "white" person. I still think the gallery is enough. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[36mWobble: I'd like to know why Marylin Monroe is supposed to be "the most iconic example of an idealised appearance of a white person." Personally I think that no man wants to look like her, whether they are "white" or otherwise, so at the very least she could only represent an idealised version of a woman. Then there's the question of her obviously non-natural hair, and the fact that most so called "white" people are not blonde anyway. I don't think there is or can ever be such a thing as an "idealised white person", at best all we can achieve is some sort of idea of the vast diversity that exists within any given group of people, and even  then we are going to omit much of the variation. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mSlrubenstein: Alun, with all due respect, you are asking the wrong question.  The question is not "why" is Marilyn Monroe the most iconic example etc.  The question is "According to whom?"  When it comes to the article, if there is research on why people have different iconic representations of white people, we can discuss that research.  But when it comes to inclusion in the gallery I think the key issues are NPOV and V.  I am sure we all agree that there is no iconic representaton of ideal Whiteness that is shared by all people.  As with most things there are multiple points of view.  It may be a good idea to include images to represent each notable view of what a "white person" is.  I do not think Usergreatpower has to explain to us why anyone consideres MM the most iconic.  But she should be able to explain to us ''who'' believes this. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mUsergreatpower: I have been bold and and added examples of white people who are undisputably white in an attempt to resolve the dispute of which examples should be shown due to dispute over who is considered white. This should now mean the article does not need to go without examples. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mRamdrake: Thank you for your efforts,  but please refer to the talk page and archives. Just adding pictures of people one feels are "undeniably white" as examples is a solution which has previously been discussed and rejected, as it was felt to be too arbitrary and not representative enough of the concept of "whiteness". rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mWikiscribe: i agree and concur with ramdrakes statement rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mWobble: I did warn Usergreatpower. Anyway, I have some alternative suggestions  if anyone would like to comment? rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mSlrubenstein: I like the idea, a lot! The point is to peg each cluster of illustrations with a specific section of the article - so the photos illustrate ''parts of the article'' rather than the title of the article. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mWikiscribe: i also am "very" supportive of this particular idea and concur with slrubenstein statement and it could put an end to the picture charade within this article rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mRamdrake: Excellent initiative! Although, Alun, we may need to do something about that wordiness of yours!! ;) rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mWobble: Sorry. I guess if the images are placed in the correct sections of the article then we don't need to explain them so thoroughly. As stand alone images in my sandbox they needed a bit more explanation. Feel free to edit the wording etc. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mWobble: OK, I cut the text down from one of the pictures, and "hid" some of the text for another. Is this any better? rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mUsergreatpower: Why no examples of people who are considered universally to be White? Why just ones who are considered by some to be White? I don't think displaying just examples of people whose status as being White is controversial is going to solve the previous problem of people not agreeing on who is really White. If anything it only exacerbates it. That's why I was in favour of having examples of people where there is no controversy over their status as being White and are universally considered to be White. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mUsergreatpower: I'd like to point out the Dravidian people are not considered by any measure I know of to be White and references are needed for the such measures mentioned in the image's description. Plus the number of methods which consider Somali people to be White are very few at best and a definite minority position. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mUsergreatpower: It's interesting to note that there are more pictures of people who most people wouldn't call White such as Africans and Indians than there are of ones most people would call White. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mWobble: What do you mean? We have John Beddoe, Lord Milner, Warren Harding, Robert Knox the image of the "Celtic group", why do you think ''none'' of those are considered "universally white"? I'd have thought that at least Knox, Beddoe and Milner were considered white by all standards. So I don't think it's at all accurate say that there are "no examples of people who are considered universally to be White". I suggest you atek a look at some of the physical anthropological works of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In these there are certainly many instances of East Africans and Indians being considered "white". Actually not that long ago there were about four different images of maps of "racial" classifications that showed just that. When one dispences with skin colour as a determining factor, as craniometry did, then we get completely different so called "races". rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
