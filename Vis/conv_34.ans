[31mYabroq: Can you just stop reveting an edit, that is clearly not vandalism, with the summary "removing vandalism". I remind you that this article is not your property WP:OWN, and that you have to address other people respectfully and not slander them with false accusation of vandalism. We're not in a Mou9ata3a here ;) OK? rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mTabrisius: YOU should stop editing with unsourced and vandal ways...Moroccan Armed Forces had been deployed in all those conflicts and there are sources posted in the article. Next time you edit i'll contact somebody to make you respect a bit others work...There are no UN missions in conflicts...SFOR, KFOR and UNITAF aren't UN missions but NATO missions, Morocco stayed in Zaire till 1979, and YES malian and mauretanian sources confirmed moroccan Special forces in MAli (See sources) So STOP editing and go read a bit about moroccan involvement in recent conflicts... rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH6: Refutation
[31mYabroq: First you are in WP:3RR violation. Where are these sources? I think you should learn a thing or two about Wikipedia. This isn't your personal blog & review the way you address others on here. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH5: Counterargument
[31mYabroq: Re content, 1) provide reliable sources for your claims (i.e. military involvement in Northern Mali conflict, or the Huthi conflict in Yemen which is just alleged. 2) Peace-keeping missions (whether UN or not) are not combat missions and therefore should not clog the infobox in place of other major conflicts. 3) The Moroccan Gendarmerie was only involved in Shaba I, remains to be proven that they did participate in Shaba II. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mYabroq: BTW whats this? a threat? "'''Next time you edit i'll contact somebody to make you respect a bit others work'''" We're on Wikipedia remember? rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mTabrisius: Are you Kiddin me?? you don't see the sources posted, are you really kiddin me?? YOUR ARE TROLLING ME?? Shaba II  , Northern Mali conflict , , ,  Operation Scorched Earth , '''READ MORE ABOUT''' Unified Task Force, SFOR and KFOR... Saying that UNITAF, SFOR and KFOR werent combat conflicts is an insult to all those who died in Serbia, Kosovo and Somalia under enemy fire. '''IF THERE ARE SOURCE ABOUT AND ARE ACCEPTED SO YOU SHOULD STOP BECAUSE ITS VANDALISM'''... '''so stop your trolling and vandalism EDITING and ERASING INFORMATION FORM MULTIPLE SOURCES (so the 3RR rule apply TO YOU not to me)''' If you want mor sources I can give you more...but stop trolling and editing as a Vandal reliable sources and verified information. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mYabroq: I think you need to calm down. Shouting and down-talking won't help persuade anybody, least me. Please read WP:RS and WP:Cite. According to the very LSE document you just linked, Morocco was not involved in Shaba II. The subsequent African peace-keeping force that was sent there IS NOT Shaba II. The alleged involvement in Operation Serval, is at best speculation and not supported by any reliable sources. (Sorry self published news sites such as maliactu.com/malijet.com aren't reliable sources). Again I reiterate that peace keeping missions (which are not battles, exception made for Mogadishu) do not belong to the infobox which should only include major military combat ops. Finally, you've thrown at me quite a few personal attacks and a threat, please take a look at WP:PA and WP:CIVIL rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH6: Refutation, DH4: Repeated argument
[32mTabrisius: Â¿me calming down? stop acting as a troll and stop acting as a victim...and read a bit the sources Â¿selfpublished sources? they are newsites and one even have a radio chanel!!! Jeuneafrique a self-published source???really?? who you are trying to convince??? Who the hell you think you are to say that a source is not valid, not one, but three differents and that have nothing to dou with Morocco or Moroccan Army or even are pro-moroccan??? you think that posting some rules will change something when you don't even know how all them work??? I've been creating, editing and publishing in wikipedia for years, don't tell me how to contribute...Shaba II was in 1978 LIKE IT IS WROTE IN THE SOURCES THAT THE MOROCCAN ARMY WAS FIGHITING IN ZAIRE WITH LUBARIS!!! WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY DOING THERE? WERE THERE ANY OTHER CONFLICTS IN ZAIRE IN 1978??? ARE WE ALL IDIOTS OR WHAT??? Stop trolling, stop acting as a vandal...you want me to put the conflicts instead of the missions? Ok...you'll have your conflicts. BW...Wich personal atacks? I MUST WARN YOU THAT YOU ARE ACTING AS A TROLL AND AS A VANDAL BEFORE CONTACTING AN ADMIN Â¿DID YOU KNOW THAT? rebuttal_labels:: DH0: Name calling/hostility, DH3: Policing the discussion, DH5: Counterargument
[34mTransporterMan: ''About your Third Opinion request:''' I am a regular volunteer at the Third Opinion Project. The request for a Third Opinion in reference to this dispute has been removed because this dispute does not meet the requirement of the Third Opinion project that, "Before making a request here, be sure that the issue has been thoroughly discussed on the article talk page. 3O is only for assistance in resolving disagreements that have come to a standstill." All moderated content dispute resolution processes at Wikipedia require extensive talk page discussion before requesting assistance. If one removes the shouting and name calling which has occurred so far in this discussion, there has been very little ''real'' discussion of the issues here and even less on-topic back and forth. For example, Tachfin has asserted that, "self published news sites such as maliactu.com/malijet.com aren't reliable sources". Discussion on that point would proceed by discussing what defines a reliable source and what defines a self published source and then examining whether the named sources meet those definitions. If help is needed to work out uncertainties, you could then ask a question at the reliable sources noticeboard. That kind of thing is clearly not what has happened here.

[31mYabroq: Thanks TransporterMan for your feedback. , I reiterate my request to you to: refrain from personal attacks, keep the discussion WP:Civil and WP:AGF. No, you do not WP:OWN this article. Trust me you're not doing yourself any favours by behaving like above. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH4: Repeated argument
