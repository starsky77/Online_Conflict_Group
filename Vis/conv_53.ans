[31m129.71.73.243: On coup sources rebuttal_labels:: 
[31m129.71.73.243: Of the sites listed, none are from a prudent, verifiable website.  Of the content, it concerns the claim of an NSA official who resigned in protest of Nixon's Vietnam War policies and became a habitual critic of US foreign policy who is ostensibly reporting third-hand information.  This is little better than a rumor, and certainly not enough to flatly assert as fact that the CIA backed it.  There has been no actual proof of this claim published. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mDabbler: The websites are reporting previously published material and do give the references. Your POV that the CIA did not assist in a coup is not a verifiable source that they did not. There are four sources of whatever quality that assert they did, you have at least to provide some that assert that they did not and even then we report the controversy, not delete one viewpoint. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31m129.71.73.243: I'm not going to provide a source that says "the CIA did not support the coup" because that is asking to prove a negative.  It is not proper to link to blogs or to unverifiable, unreliable, sources per Wikipedia policy (and general good sourcing guidelines).  None of the links provided fit that standard.  If a ''New York Times'' link is found that gives the NSA official's comment, it can go in, but it would need to be heavily qualified. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mDabbler: I am suggesting that we report the controversy not try and pretend that no one has ever suggested that the CIA was involved. I changed the article to reflect that. You cannot deny that there have been reports for decades that the CIA was involved, regardless of whether it was true or not, and this is therefore relevant and should be included. If you can't even find a sourced statement that the CIA was not involved, then you should not be deleting sourced content. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31m129.71.73.243: You are suggesting that one should prove a negative in order to propagate some contrived "debate".  It is not relevant that some random official says he heard third-hand what the CIA supposedly did any more than it is relevant to the issue of bin Laden's biography that a random 21st century British politician said that the CIA supported him, in light of the noticeable failure to produce evidence on that point.  Spurious accusations with no proof have no place inside an encyclopedia, and in any case (as I already noted) the links themselves are not proper. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mDabbler: The reports are numerous, the references are from reputable sources, they just don't match your POV. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31m129.71.73.243: Simply asserting as much is not adequate, and this doesn't address what I am actually saying. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31m129.71.73.243: Again, this article is relying largely on Morris to say things there is no published proof of.  Links from random web sites don't pass muster with WP:RS, much less ''Newsmax'', which has about as much credibility as "''Common Dreams''".  I notice also how this isn't even referring to the same incident; it seems as if you went on a desperate Google search to get something to stick and sufficed for similarly spurious information on a previous incident. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mDabbler: Actually I copied the information and link from Saddam Hussein where it is considered to be an acceptable reference. Perhaps you had better go over there and start deleting referenced material from that article too. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31m129.71.73.243: I have no doubt (and I do not know why anyone should not) that there are a great number of Wikipedia articles that are improperly sourced (at least in parts), especially on such very contentious matters.  Regarding the issue of Google, it was perhaps an unfair characterization to make, but it is an aside.  I don't really believe it to be my duty to go on a general source-verification-crusade on this web site (lord knows it is not within the capacity of a thousand people, much less one), but this is one issue I have taken an interest in where I believe some respect for minimum standards should prevail.  Incidentally, Saddam Hussein is protected. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mDabbler: So I understand from the comment above that your deletion is based on original research, which is not a valid basis for including or excluding information from article.  Saddam Hussein is not protected for editor's with a vaild User Name. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31m129.71.73.243: I have no idea how you could possibly come to that conclusion.  I am not conducting or presenting original research, I am using common sense and guidelines in evaluating sources and claims for an encyclopedia article.  That is what all editors should be doing. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mDabbler: So it is your "common sense" rather than your "original research" that normally reliable sources such as The Guardian, Reuters, NYT etc. quoted in websites which you consider to be unreliable make those sources unreliable? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mDabbler: All I am asking is that you agree to allow it to be noted (with sources) that there have been people who have said that the CIA and/or American government agencies were involved in the coup against Qasim and that the CIA aided Saddam in his attempted assassination. You are very welcome to provide other '''sourced''' statements to the effect that these allegations are nonsense, but I don't believe you should exclude them completely because they exist. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34m71.234.193.215: The link to the NYTimes Article published March 14th 2003, by Roger Morris is as follows "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505EFDB103EF937A25750C0A9659C8B63&scp;=1&sq;=sadaam%20morris&st;=cse". I think this clears up any dispute as to the credibility of the blog where this was originally posted.   â€”Preceding unsigned comment added by rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
