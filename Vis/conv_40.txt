{'text': 'The recent addition of a series of obscure awards throughout the Career section gives the article a fan-oriented POV. Less notable awards should be omitted, and the article could use a more general balancing with negative material, which there is plenty of out there.', 'username': 'DrFleischman', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
{'text': 'Again, I\'m no fan of Dana Loesch but I am a woman. The distinctions listed are higher accolades than many which are included in other living persons biographies on WP and they go unchallenged. The idea that the awards didn\'t have an impact on her notoriety and rise is foolish. Further the inclusion of particular distinctions of her political persuasion may be considered by some (myself included) as negative material. It is how you view it. The facts are what they are and introduction of "negative material" invites the inclusion of actual positive material. I think the facts are what they are and are always neutral. WP practices instruct us to only include neutral facts in the spirit of consensus.', 'username': 'Mach7X77', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument', 'DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': "I'm not sure what much of that means. I stand by the tag and I believe the inclusion of the large number of obscure awards gives readers the impression that we're going out of our way to puff up the piece and make Loesch look good, whether that's your intention or not. Please do not remove the tag without first obtaining consensus.", 'username': 'DrFleischman', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'If you don\'t understand what that means then I cannot help you. You have already demonstrated that you don\'t understand the qualifications that publishers use for a Best Selling Author. Your insistance on questioning sources and adding your bias to this is beyond the bounds of working towards any consensus, it is antithetical to consensus. Much has been changed to your satisfaction and you seem to want to drive for some odd sense of dictatorial type editorial control over the page. The awards and distinctions are not obscure in any way and are central to the story of any rising media personality. Your insistence on them being obscure doesn\'t make Nielsen, AIM, Biz Journal etc... obscure. If you aren\'t wanting this to be an actual biographical page then perhaps you should start an "I hate Dana Loesch" page on facebook. The biographies of thousands of other people on Wikipedia feature far more obscure awards and distinctions as this page. Obscure would mean that they weren\'t journaled or heralded on many sites. Your tone is personally insulting to me and anyone who would present an accurate, thorough and fair biography and also seem to be anti-feminist in nature. There are thousands of other pages that need your immediate attention if your personal criteria that you use on this page is consistent. I have to wonder what your end-game really is here. There is no consensus for the tag and it will be removed every time you introduce your bias. If something makes a person look good or bad in YOUR EYES isn\'t the qualification of its inclusion or omission, facts are just facts, omission is bias and conjecture is forbidden.', 'username': 'Mach7X77', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument', 'DH3: Policing the discussion', 'DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': "Most of your comment seems unproductive. I only have 2 things to say:\n1. These awards and distinctions are obscure for the very reason that they're not journaled or heralded on many sites. We should only be considering independent, reliable sources as others have self-interested reasons to puff up the notability of awards. This is a pretty common type of analysis all across Wikipedia. Show me the independent sources demonstrating the notability of these awards.\n2. Do not remove the tag until consensus is reached. Doing so is contrary to the tag and accepted tagging procedures. The tag expressly says the article ''may be'' non-neutral, it doesn't say the article ''is'' non-neutral. I am re-adding the tag.", 'username': 'DrFleischman', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': "1. Do not add a POV tag without consensus - it IS against WP practices and standards, you show me the sources and consensus that the distinctions and awards - which are factual and listed across the internet in regards to Mrs. Loesch - are somehow obscure and not journaled when they are. You are like the guy that said Loesch wasn't even notable enough to have a WP page to begin with. Ridiculous.\n2. You are not the sole arbiter of what should hap[pen on this page. I have compromised for the spirit of consensus, your edits seems to be from a hateful point of view.", 'username': 'Mach7X77', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH4: Repeated argument', 'DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'Not sure what is meant by "obscure awards" when chronicling a person\'s rise to prominence. The awards show a shift from popular thought writing to a more conservatively focused writing. I think it\'s important information. I\'m wondering why the Post dispatch let her go with an award winning column... Was it based on her ideas? I also find it interesting that someone would claim this is a "fan POV" when there is very unflattering information included in the biography; college dropout, banned from shows, Breitbart spirit award (not a good feather IMHO). I see no reason to flag this page. I\'m ambivalent towards Loesch and this page is balanced as is. A tag like that should not be added without consensus. While I\'m not a feminist by any means, I have to agree with   on this.', 'username': 'Mordor2', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH4: Stating your stance'], 'coordination_labels': []}
