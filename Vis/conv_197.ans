[31mIIIraute: Gender Discrimination Law Suit rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMostlyoksorta: It is only an allegation and it will be stated as such in the article, it was cited in two newspapers.  An allegation of gender discrimination is clearly worthy of being noted. (  ) rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mMostlyoksorta: Also please no section blanking, this story was covered in two of the biggest newspapers in New York City and is a Federal Civil Rights Case. (  ) rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mMostlyoksorta: Also I don't understand what your citations above indicate?  I have read the complaint in this matter and it is a Title VII Gender Discrimination suit under the Civil Rights Act.  Are you somehow diminishing that?  (  ) rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mIIIraute: It is only an allegation yet. Also please note ‚Üí Wikipedia:BOLD, revert, discuss cycle rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH5: Counterargument
[32mMostlyoksorta: A lawsuit is not only an allegation it is a lawsuit, I never wrote anything that imputes the veracity of the allegations. (  ) rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mMostlyoksorta: Also as far as I can see pending legal disputes are treated as valid topics on wikipedia (  ) rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mIIIraute: Quote (Mostlyoksorta), "''I never wrote anything that imputes the veracity of the allegations.''", unqote. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance

[32mMostlyoksorta: well i deleted it because i thought it was uncivil, but here is my whole uncivil rant for you if you want it      listen homie and by homie I mean IIIraute I'm not the one who blanks sections, deletes the most recent material, and I never said I have two accounts, I said I know another person I was working with. If you feel like spending your time propping up some semi-elitist internet scam, I sure hope your getting paid for it. I am glad you can also quote an elitist English order, congrats on your French. You are the best Sherlock Holmes on Wikipedia. So feel free to continue trying to delete a section on a Gender Discrimination case that is pending in a federal court. I am sure that helps you sleep at night. Just cause you are self proclaimed high wizard of wikipedia or whatever you think you are doesn't mean I haven't put up valid current sources of relevant material. So go back to playing with your magic want and quoting semi-extinct cults of England.

[31mIIIraute: 'I am not the same person as Faceplant2020, though it is rather intimidating to me that you are barreling through my privacy, but I spoke to Faceplant2020 and will you let you know that I know that person. We did discuss edits together, which as far as I know is ok. Faceplant2020 will stay out the deletion debate if that makes you happy? As for any IP address, as you can tell we are both new to this so maybe someone forgot to log on, we're on public computers sometimes? Anyway, I hope that ends the belligerent Sherlock Holmes part of this discussion, and we can focus on whether or not the 500,000th/38,000th most important site on the internet, which is plagued with advertising material and non-neutral should stay on Wikipedia. It's pretty simple. Thanks'' here rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mMostlyoksorta: um, what here? (  ) rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMostlyoksorta: and um also, what is your goal to fight me or put up the most relevant well supported material, because as far as I can see you are the only one who keeps pushing on a personal fight.  I asked other editors for their opinions.  When I proposed this page for deletion I notified almost everyone who voted - AND THEY ALL VOTED AGAINST DELETION - you see I am just learning at this, I ask other editors for help.  I have even asked you for help.  So seriously what is your deal?  Why are you fighting against the just inclusion of a section citing 2 of the 3 biggest papers in New York?  Why are you deleting my assertation (100% factual and NPOV - and TAKEN FROM ASW's own site) that they now accept membership applications?  What is your beef?

[32mMostlyoksorta: like i said at the time i am on a shared computer and have to login and off.  when i proposed for deletion i forgot to login, but i quickly corrected myself in all further edits on this matter (  ) rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mIIIraute: Hitherto, nothing more than an allegation: "''Tonny Uy has filed a gender-discrimination lawsuit against his former empress ployer, A Small World, where he worked as an accountant. He claims he lost his job because he asked for the same amount of paid family leave given to female workers.''" & "''A man says his Manhattan employer ‚Äî an exclusive online social network for the rich ‚Äî fired him because he asked for the same amount of paid family leave given to female workers.''" here"''Man sues employer for alleged firing over paternity leave''" & "''A gay man socked his snooty employer ‚Äî a social-networking site that bills itself as a ‚Äúmyspace for millionaires‚Äù ‚Äî with a lawsuit Wednesday alleging that he was wrongfully fired after seeking paternity leave when his daughter was born.''" here rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mMostlyoksorta: also please stop revealing what you think to be personal information about me. It is threatening and  I mentioned before and violates Wikipedia policy. New York is a big place with lots of people, so I'm not sure what your claim can be  meant as other than a threat (  )(  ) rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mIIIraute: 'I am a member'' "''If they don't accept you don't worry I'll send you an invitation''""''... if you don't believe me why don't you apply, I'm pretty sure they will just charge your credit card and not send you 'an invitation.' ... I'll warn you though if you do apply, you probably will ask for your money back hahahaha ;)''"You are clearly biased - and your edits are not NPOV! rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mMostlyoksorta: what is not NPOV about stating that there is a pending federal lawsuit? I am still missing the point? THERE IS A FEDERAL CASE INVOLVING ASMALLWORLD - if I was not NPOV I would mention my feelings on that issue, which are less than favorable.  However, I simply stated a very clear fact.  There is a case against ASW and that involves gender discrimination. (  ) rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mMostlyoksorta: Also I have been honest, you never answered ARE YOU PAID BY ASW? (  ) rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mMostlyoksorta: also don't be jealous that I am the member of an ultra exclusive club and your not, JK get a sense of humor brother (  ) rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mMostlyoksorta: also, once you are done answering whether or not you accept compensation from ASW, please let me know why your entire talk page history is filled with conflicts, why are you so into page blanking and starting fights? It can't be so boring in whatever little town you live in (  ) rebuttal_labels:: DH0: Name calling/hostility
[32mMostlyoksorta: also i think it is very hypocritical that you are citing arguing about this topic when you were a frequent contributor to ANOTHER PENDING LEGAL MATTER Oscar Pistorius' trial.  Not sure why you think it is ok to write about that trial and not this one.  So I'll ask another question, what is your substantive problem with this Law Suit section?

[31mIIIraute: I did not revert this content again, so I am not fighting anything - however, IMHO your contributions to this article are not NPOV, and look like some kind of revenge campaign - you have mentioned private e-mails you have exchanged with the company, and also this. Both, the RipoffReport Complaint Review, and your first edits on this article (together with User:Faceplant2020 and the IP), happen to share the same date: 28. March 2014. Please note that the IP also relocates to New York; i.e. the same location from the RipoffReport Complaint Review. In your comment above, you did write: "''When I proposed this page for deletion...''" - however, please be aware of the fact, that it was the IP that proposed the deletion of the article.
