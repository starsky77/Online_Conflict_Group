[31mOnceinawhile: Sentences on the Levant rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mOnceinawhile: the sentences you added back do not refer to the Southern Levant, but to the Levant itself. They are already in that article and add nothing here except confusion. Can you please either edit the sentences to make them relevant to this article, or else remove them. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mOnceinawhile: Also, removing citation needed tags without adding citations is pure disruptive behaviour. Your crusade to support the use of this term has begun to reach into the depths of dishonesty. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mDrsmoo: Incorrect, both sources refer directly to the Southern Levant. The fact that you so casually remove sources, when even a cursory glance would have shown their direct relevance to the subject and applicability, is extremely troubling. I advise you to cease personal attacks as well. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH4: Stating your stance
[34mLaurel Lodged: It seems very strange that one would want to delete sources supporting a position that CN is no longer needed. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mOnceinawhile: The sources may, but not in a way that was relevant to the sentences they were being used to support. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mDrsmoo: You should actually read the sources before making hostile/aggressive edits and personal attacks. The "strictly geographical" source is referring specifically to the term Southern Levant. The "cultural corpus" source is referring to Southern Levant as well as the Levant as a whole. If you had spent half the time reading the sources as you had removing them and making personal attacks there  wouldn't be an issue. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[31mOnceinawhile: If this is right I am willing to accept fault. But on the other hand if that's right, then you should have fixed it instead of blindly and aggressively reverting. There is still no source for the first sentence, the second needs proper linking, and the third sentence is inaccurate and needs amending. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mOnceinawhile: And the equivalent sentence at Levant will need editing too. You can't have it mean one thing here and another there. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mDrsmoo: Your personal attacks alleging "blindly and aggressively reverting" are incorrect. The sentences are all correctly cited. Additionally, your use of "you" is incorrect. This is not about you vs me. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Stating your stance
[31mOnceinawhile: Ok let's both try to depersonalize this.
Do you intend to fix the problems identified? Or do you want me to? rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mDrsmoo: There aren't any problems. You erroneously removed sources from the article and then added tags as if the sources didn't exist. I restored the sources and removed the incorrect tags. I also moved the source for "strictly geographical" to directly follow the relevant sentence (previously it was following the section as a whole) but that's a cosmetic change. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mOnceinawhile: Points 1 and 3 above remain unresolved. Do you have a solution here? And point 2 needs a fix - the sentence says "authors", yet we only have one (who also calls the phrase "awkward"). rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mOnceinawhile: Specifically:
Today, the term Southern Levant" is primarily found in the fields of archaeology and history" => citation needed
The term has been used by authors wishing to present a strictly geographical description => citation needed
Scholars have adopted the term Levant to identify the region due to it being a wider, yet relevant, cultural corpus" that does not have the "political overtones" of Syria-Palestine,[2][3]" => why are we talking about the Levant, with a sentence copied from that article? Applying it here brings a clear SYNTH implication. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mDrsmoo: Laurel Lodged and I seem to be in agreement that there is no issue here aside from your edits. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mOnceinawhile: Don't try to sully other people with your own bad judgements. So you are willing to leave 1. an unsourced statement, 2. an inaccurate statement extrapolating from a single author and leaving out a relevant negative comment, and 3. a sentence relevant only to another article left here as Synth? These are blatant violations of wikipedia's principles. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion, DH5: Counterargument
[32mDrsmoo: Read the source. Since you are unwilling or unable to cease personal attacks, I'll be reporting you. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mDrsmoo: Late edit, just wanted to point out the humor in someone who for over a year has been trying to personalize edits on wikipedia (with personal attacks, starting attacks by pinging only one editor rather than addressing the articles editors as a whole) calling to then "depersonalize" only to then immediately resume personal attacks.
Just wanted to point out the humor in the immediate resumption of personal attacks after calling to depersonalize (which occurred after pinging me, rather than addressing the page's edits as a whole.) As "personal" and uncivil as I've seen from any wikipedia editor, ever. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mOnceinawhile: , I am not going to respond in kind to this. If you would like to move on and try to rebuild some semblance of a working relationship between us, then I would be very pleased to do so. If we could find a way to stop fighting, I suspect we could work well together. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mDrsmoo: There's no issue with calling out incivility and personal attacks. Editing should be directed towards the community as a whole, and work to engage outside editors when possible. Constantly directing agressive remarks and demands at a single editor, while making personal attacks is disruptive. As is opening up several simultaneous talk page discussions on the same point. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mOnceinawhile: , playing to the gallery is not going to help us work together. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mOnceinawhile: If you want to try to rebuild a working relationship, I am ready. rebuttal_labels::
