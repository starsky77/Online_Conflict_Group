{'text': "I am in partial agreement with  regarding sources for things like the OBE. Stories that appear in much of the news media within the first couple of days after an event like this are forced to rely on information that has not yet had time to be properly researched. Sometime, their information comes (uncredited) from other news agencies so they all end up saying the same thing, true or not. If the first news source got the OBE information from Munroe's web-site or even from Wikipedia (irony of ironies), then everyone will report it, since it's not a critical fact. So, I think it is wise to be slow to put these things into a page.

It's already a reliable source (Fox News Latino is a reliable source as well, most certainly).  It's coming from two reliable sources - one in the UK - and we have no way of knowing where they go their information.  To think they got what they've written from Wikipedia is using pure speculation and probably falls under WP:CRYSTAL to some degree.
