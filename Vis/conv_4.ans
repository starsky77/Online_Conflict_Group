[31mMhhossein: Paul Craig Roberts rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMhhossein: I just wanted to let you know that you had probably missed a point in self-published sources that ''"Self-published expert sources may be considered reliable when produced by an established expert on the subject matter, whose work in the relevant field has previously been published by reliable third-party publications."'' Paul Craig Roberts, as his page shows, is an expert with enough experience. you may look at his CV and the books he has authored. So, I'll  undo your edit. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mAnders Feder: I did look at his CV, which says he is an economist. How does that make him an established expert on Iran or communication studies? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mMhhossein: He doesn't need to be an established expert on Iran or communication studies for making such a comment. As you see he has authored books such as "How America Was Lost: From 9/11 to the Police/Warfare State" and "The Capitalist Revolution in Latin America" and consider that Economics is not a discrete field falling far from political issues. He seems experienced enough for judging "Western politicians and media". rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mAnders Feder: If you read your own quotation above: "Self-published expert sources  be considered reliable ." Is economics the subject matter of the ayatollah's letter or any matter surrounding it? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mMhhossein: Of course, the action of sending such a letter as a message to the youth is within the realm of his expertise. By the way, he is not merely an economist, as his published views suggest. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH4: Repeated argument
[32mAnders Feder: That is not what I asked. Answer my question, please. His views are completely irrelevant - Wikipedia is not a soapbox.  (UTC rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mMhhossein: It is already answered. 1-Economics is not a discrete field falling far from social issues. 2- his published views are relevant to such a social issue. 3- He authored books on economical and socio political issues. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mAnders Feder: Yes or no? Sidestepping the question does not result in it being answered. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mMhhossein: It is not sidestepping. Please read the comments to get your answer and consider that he is not merely an economist. Btw is it merely an economical book? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
