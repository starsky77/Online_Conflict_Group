[31mKrzyhorse22: User:Faizan insists on adding "Afghan militants" in the infobox but the sources (Pakistani news reports) do not even mention any Afghan militant group.   Second, the United States is not involved in this operation. Finally, the subject of this article should only be the operation. Can we not fill this article with personal views of Pakistani news editors regarding Afghan politicians. rebuttal_labels::

[32mFaizan: I will not re add this news about non-cooperation of Afghanistan, However I am looking for more references. Whether the "Haqqani Network" is Afghan or not, the provided reference clearly states that the operation is against Haqqani Network too. Agreed about the non-involvement of US. Now, regarding the use of Afghan Militants, the references provided clearly state that the militants were attacking from across the Afghan border.
From this one: "a group of terrorists crossed over from Afghanistan and attacked the Dandi Kuch post in Spinwam area of North Waziristan." From that one: "70 to 80 militants attacked the check post in the cross-border attack at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border."
I hope this solves the confusion. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mSaadkhan12345: I agree...sources do not mention afghan militias...they could be pakistani or uzbek or irani...we know fazlulah of tehreek e taliban is hiding in afghanistan..militias attacking paki ...seems like his job...but CIA drones are involved in operation zarb-e-azb...i think what krzyhorse22 is trying to say is tht it hasnt been officially announced but thy are playing a big role here. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mFaizan: Well obviously the militants attacking from inside of Afghanistan are "Afghan militants". Even the arab, central asian, Pakistani militants operating inside Pakistan are referred to as "Pakistani". The main concerned thing is the "Area of Operations". Haqqani Network also has operations both inside Pak and Afg. The term "Terrorists from Afghanistan" used by the above source clarifies this. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument

2	2014-11-03 17:39:45	Faizan	The source says MILITANTS FROM AFGHANISTAN" and "MILITANTS FROM ACROSS THE BORDER", which just implies that it is talking about "Afghan Militants". rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mKrzyhorse22: The basic rule is that we only put verifiable information, no opinions, speculations or implying. There has never been any Afghan militant group fighting against Pakistan. Why would they? They are only against NATO presence inside Afghanistan and that's their reason for fighting in that country. These militants all belong to a group, there are no lone wolf militants. Faizan, "militants from Afghanistan" only has one meaning, and is not a reference to Afghans. It is referring to the listed militants who sometimes hide in mountains of Afghanistan and sometimes in Pakistan, they should not be labelled Afghans. The term "Afghan" refers to a citizen of Afghanistan. We should avoid listing the wrong people. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mKrzyhorse22: Regarding the Haqqani network, it has 4000-15000 members. All we know is that the founder and a few top leaders were born in Afghanistan. We need to verify if this group is actually involved or not. Not long ago this is what top US officials told the media, "There is evidence linking the Haqqani Network to the Pakistan government."  I'm not saying Pakistan is not fighting with this group but we need a reliable source to prove it. This Pakistani news report  is only addressing that Afghanistan helps catch leader of TTP, Fazlullah, which is a different group from Haqqani. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mTheSawTooth: I move to dispute your revision because they are Afghan militants if the reference is saying that they are from that country. You can not defend your country on Wikipedia you have to go and take real action if a fact like this is upsetting you. Wikipedia is only trying to report journalism. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mSaadkhan12345: first of all you removed CIA DRONE from the article...Im assuming you dont know shit about operation. If you scroll down theres a whole section on drone strikes taking out more than 50 militants. Secondly, im not from afghanistan...Im from pakistan. Third...theres a difference between '''AFGHAN militants''' and '''MILITANTS from Afghanistan'''. last but not least Operation Zarb-e-azb is based in North Waziristan District......as for the cross border attacks they are not Part of the operation...The main mission of the operation is clearing out north waziristan...quote  "against foreign and local terrorists who were hiding in sanctuaries in North Waziristan tribal region."(http://www.dawn.com/news/1112909/pakistan-launches-zarb-e-azb-military-operation-in-n-waziristan)  '''just because theres something with sources doesnt mean its part of the article.''' rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mFaizan: I said it before that it does not matter that the Haqqanis are Pakistanis or Afghan or Uzbeks. All that matters is that the Pakistani security officials have declared that the operation is also against them. And so, Haqqani Network would be included in the infobox. Secondly, according to the reliable sources given above in the "Extended Content", the intruders attack Pakistan from "across the border". Across the border simply means that it is the Afghans. The wording used by the source is exactly "Militants from Afghanistan", so this is undisputable. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mFaizan: Nah... Even killing of terrorists in Khyber Agency is reported under the heading of Zarb-e-Azb. Yes, as the forces which are stationed for the Operation Zarb-e-Azb are attacked by Afghan terrorists, the counter attack simply makes it a part of the Operation.

[32mFaizan: Mr. , please refrain from personal attacks and harassment. You are trying to blame and harass entire Pakistanis, please do not mock to ownership of articles and try to get consensus for your non-popular uni-lateral nationalistic changes. And I don't want to discuss the merits of Afghanistan here. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mKrzyhorse22: Personal attacks and harassment? Every knowledgeable person about this region (Afghanistan-Pakistan-India) agrees with my statement. It is recommended that people with knowledge edit this article. You called Afghans terrorists in your statement but we never seen terrorist attacks done by Afghans inside Pakistan. Therefore, you're the one with the problem. I didn't even edit this stinky article since November 2, so regarding ownership of articles, what are you talking about? The discussion here is not about Afghanistan, it's you wrongly adding "Afghan militants" in the infobox due to your personal feeling and using the old falsification of sources method, which is blockable if you keep repeating it regardless how long you've been editing Wikipedia. Accept the fact that Pakistani terrorists are killing Pakistani citizens  and that Pakistan's government started this operation against them (and the few foreigners that may be with them). Most of us editors don't give a rats ass about Pakistani, Afghan, Indian, American, or our own nationality, we only come here to improve articles based on WP:NPOV and WP:ACCURACY. I say that because in Wikipedia there is no nationality, we could claim to be a citizen of any country. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[31mKrzyhorse22: Faizan is POV pushing and this is simply unacceptable. He's engaged in the blame game. Like most Pakistanis, he rejects the idea that Pakistan itself is known globally as a major terrorist training ground. I mean look at every terrorist attack that was carried out in USA and the UK, they all involved Pakistani terrorists. Instead, he wants to portray Pakistan as a peace loving and civilized country such as USA that is being attacked by Afghans. This sort of thinking is just weird and un-comprehensible to any person of ordinary intelligence. In other words, he's trying to falsify well established fact. Some Afghans are possibly enrolled in the listed groups but that's something to address in the articles of those groups. Why specifically list Afghans and not Arabs, Uzbeks from Uzebkistan, Chechens, Tajikistanis, and the so many others? I think we all know, based on news reports, that Pakistanis hate Afghans and Indians but Wikipedia is not the place for this. We need to interpret the sources accurately, without exaggerating or adding personal opinions. Anyway, the Pentagon in Washington, DC, as well as Afghanistan's government and others, have been claiming for the last decade or so that Pakistan is using certain militant groups (i.e. Haqqani network) to carry out attacks inside Afghanistan in order to weaken the Afghan state and NATO forces.  There are countless RSs to support these claims. However, Pakistan always denies it. So this is the complicated issue here. Do we trust what NATO leaders say or do we trust Pakistanis? rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
