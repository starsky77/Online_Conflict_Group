[31mDissidentAggressor: Looks like vandalism. That whole section needs sources, people. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mDhtwiki: You're talking about her being added to faculty? That happened here, where Ruth Westheimer was one of two additions, the first, corrected to Bonanno in the next edit, seems legitimate. Perhaps the editor was confused, rather than vandalistic. As far as needing sources, I assume the the linked pages will suffice to give bona fides as to the association with Teacher's College. Westheimer has been listed amongst alumni since 2007, at least. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mDissidentAggressor: Ok, great - It looked like a prank (me being a skeptic).  As far as the sources, this is a common misconception.  Per WP:NLIST, ''"every entry in any such list requires a reliable source attesting to the fact that the named person is a member of the listed group."''  So, no the linked pages do not suffice. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mDhtwiki: WP:NLIST doesn't say that the source has to be found on this page (very few lists that I've seen are well sourced directly). All the names on the faculty list have their own articles, and thus are notable. Whether their association with the college is documented there is another matter. If it's not and can be, then that source should be added to their main article page. If it can't be then the name probably should be struck here. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mDissidentAggressor: NLIST sez Every entry must have a reliable source '''attesting to the fact that the person is a member of the list.''' It can't be clearer than that.   Their articles may or may not attest to that membership - that's why that statement is in NLIST. The WP:BURDEN is on the person that adds information to any article to support it.  BURDEN goes on to say any material lacking '''a reliable source directly supporting it''' may be removed and should not be restored without an inline citation to a reliable source.   This is a fundamental tenet of WP:V.
I agree that there is a lot of unsourced stuff throughout the project but the fact that Wikipedia is filled with crap is not relevant. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mDhtwiki: OK, but I think that the source you found, if it isn't already at Westheimer's page (assuming that's not where you found it) should be there, as well as here, or you're going to have a very fragmented encyclopedia, with tidbits scattered throughout. And unsourced information isn't automatically "crap" as has just been shown. Where you though vandalism, and I thought confusion, it turned out that the addition of Westheimer to the faculty list was appropriate. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
