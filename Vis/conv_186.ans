[31m174.7.14.105: I think the infobox should be changed to the one that the Prime Minister of the UK and the President of the US have. It look much more professional and has more info, like the residence and website. I have tried to change it but someone keeps cahnging it back so I would like to disscuss it here and see what everyone thinks. Tell me if you like it or not. (To see what it would look like see the President of the US or Prime Minister of the UK page.) rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMiesianiacal: If you wanted more information in the box, all you had to do was change the template or ask someone to do it for you. I have put into the template used here the additional slots the other one has. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMiesianiacal: The template you keep deleting was designed so as to use a colour coding system to differentiate between ministers in simple states and federations, as well as between federal and provincial/state ministers in the latter. You are not entitled to bulldoze all of that out of the way because you don't like it or because of what's done on other pages (though, the infobox employed here is used on other articles as well). rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31m174.7.14.105: Okay... I still don't agree. The Prime Minister of the UK has almost the exact same job as the Prime Minster of Canada so they should have the same infobox. It makes no difference. It would look better and more professional and the info it the same. I don't care if it was designed for whatever. When something needs to be changed to something more modern and better looking we should change it. I am willing to change all the provincial and federal position that have that. I will do it because i believe it looks much better. Lets just see what everyone else thinks befopre you change it back. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mMiesianiacal: You've already seen what I think; per WP:BRD it is '''you''' who should cease and decist with the reverting and discuss your changes ''before'' they are implemented. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31m174.7.14.105: I don't think so. We should stop here and see what people think. Lets leave it like this and wait for people's responses. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mMiesianiacal: What you think is irrelevant. You cannot waltz in here and impose your will on the community, ignoring policy and guideline, together. What's there now stays for the time being because we've both reached our respective 3RR limit, and for no other reason. It will be restored to the long-standing consensus version as soon as possible. In the mean time, I'm working on the issues you raised r.e. the coloured infobox, despite your despicable behaviour and attitude. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[31m174.7.14.105: If you can make it so the words aren't slanted and look bold an professional like the other one with the other info then I will accept the original infobox. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMiesianiacal: Yes, I am trying to do just that. Contending with your multiple revert wars is making it take some time longer, though. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31m174.7.14.105: Okay. Sorry. I've stopped.  â€”Preceding unsigned comment added by rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMiesianiacal: Is it better now? rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mGoodDay: I've changed the Infobox back to its status ''before'' the edit spat. The onus is on the pro-changer to get an agreement. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31m174.7.14.105: Thanks, Miesianiacal rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMiesianiacal: You're welcome. Just ask next time if you don't know how to do it yourself. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMiesianiacal: Now, you're inserting incorrect information into the box, particularly about the Prime Minister's term. The constitutional maximum life of a parliament is completely irrelevant. The Prime Minister serves as such from the second he is appointed to that position until someone else is sworn in to replace him, regardless of whether parliament has been dissolved. Please restore the correct phrase, At Her Majesty's Pleasure. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mMiesianiacal: Never mind, actually. I've managed to fix it. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mGoodDay: FWIW: ways the PM leaves office. 1) can be fired by the Queen (through the Governor General) - See King-Byng Affair as an example. 2) resign from office, which is what out-going PM's do. 3) die in office, such as Macdonald & Thompson. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMiesianiacal: True. But, why did you italicise the date of Harper's appontment as PM? have you not inserted the date of Harper's appointment properly - in the right field and without italics? rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mGoodDay: I was trying to get to match the other 'office incumbent' infoboxes. PS: The out-going PM has to resign ''before'' his/her successor is appointed. In theory, one could be PM permanently (until death, resignation, getting fired). Of course, the Queen/GG tend to bend to Parliament's wishes. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMiesianiacal: Fixed to be in line with the other infoboxes, GD (as earlier noted to you elsewhere).
Now, I wonder if the anon (or his/her brother - difficult to tell as they use the same IP and seem to hold the exact same opinions) would care to explain why we should include code for an infobox field that doesn't exist. rebuttal_labels::
