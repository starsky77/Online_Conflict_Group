{'text': 'Prince Laborec is a tale, the Kievian Rus was established in !!882!! and before that the Novgorodian Rus did not have any influence on this territory. So, the Rus in Carpathian Ruthenia at the start of 9th century is not correct. Moreover the Hungarian Etelköz (today south/southwest Ukraine, Moldova) was the eastern neighbour of Carpathian Ruthenia in the 9th century. The descendants of White Croat nobles could have intermarried with Hungarian nobles, but Ruthenian nobles could not, because there was no such a thing as "Ruthenian nobles" in the 9/10 th centuries in Carpathian Ruthenia.', 'username': 'Fakirbakir', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'I disagree with your interpretation. Firstly, we cannot conclude from this source that prince Laborec was not real person.

In modern Croatian "povijest" means simply "history". Furthermore, here we have two additional sources that speaking about Prince Laborec like about real person: , .

{'text': 'I think Ruthenian nobles (alias nobles of Rus) intermarried with Hungarian nobles, but that is a latter effect, it started probably from the 11th century.
