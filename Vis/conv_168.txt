{'text': 'Hello Friends ! in compliance with WP policies, i want a dispute resolution by some neutral WP admin. It all started when i first time read this article i found the following wording in the lead paras;\nHowever, elections held in 2014 saw highest voters turnout in 25 years of history in Kashmir.European Union also welcomed elections, called it free and fair" and congratulated India for its democratic system.The European Parliament also takes cognizance of the fact that a large number of Kashmiri voters turned out despite calls for the boycott of elections by certain separatist forces.\nIt looked out of place in the lead because this election dealt only 45% land area of kashmir state which is disputed between india, Pakistan and China. It also looked pro india because it ignored wining pro india chief minister and wining party head comments giving credit to Pakistan and separatists for allowing elections in the state. so i inserted it with indian source reference as follows.\nHowever, elected Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Muhammad Sayeed said, "If God forbid the Hurriyat and the militants tried to disrupt the elections these would not have been as participative as they had been. They (Pakistan) also allowed these elections to take place." Ruling Party president Mehbooba Mufti also defended Mufti\'s remarks.', 'username': '39.47.121.0', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}

{'text': ', No need to add "separatists does not tried to disrupt elections", because there are numerous sources where separatist hurriyat leaders appealed to boycott elections.

So word "separatist" should not be included in lead stating that they didn\'t disrupted election. But "militants" are those who use arms and do terror attack, though there was no such major terror incidence during elections still we can\'t say that its because of Pakistan was not willing to do any attack or they could not do it because of strong security during elections. Still mufti thanked Pakistan for that, he thanked militants.

Additionally Current statement in the lead " elections held in 2014 saw highest voter turnout in the last 25 years" is strange and just like Deceptive marketing tactic we usually face around the world where advertiser claims best or highest in this or that (with only  favorable comparisons) which is a malpractice and is tried to be forcefully denied by regulatory authorities. Please see relevant wikipedia article here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_advertising. In election under discussion Turn out was lowest compare to election in  other indian states even less then azad kashmir and gilgit baltistan, interestingly no one highlighted that.

In the presence of European union note why to put extras like European parliament note or EU any other administrative unit/ department note.\n2. Election had improved turnout as per one party (India) which was never denied by other party (Pakistan or Separatist) so there is no need for certificate service from European Union because no party dis agreed to this statement.\n3.
