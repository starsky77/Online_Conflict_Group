[31mRmcsamson: And we're back to square one rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mRmcsamson: The disputed section on the status of the J.D. in academia has now fallen into the same old problems of the original versions, with just some minor changes in the wording of the section itself. Sorry, but I can't help but note the bickering by more or less the same editors over the same little things. Can't we just strengthen the sections on the different variants of the J.D.? That might be better than trying to cram something into one section. This appears to have been the way that the article on the M.D. has gone. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mSawagner201: I agree that we should follow the structure of the MD articlespecifically in how it allows for international variantsthereby making the article more clear as a whole.  Putting everything in one section confuses the issue and implies that the degree is identical everywhere.  I think it would stabilize the JD article quite a bit. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mWikiant: No, the real problem is that putting everything in one section makes the issue crystal clear. We have gone the route of dividing the information among the rest of the article. What follows are numerous tweaks: inserting "doctor," "terminal," "graduate," and pictures of doctoral robes throughout; then comes the corresponding tweaks on the other side. You don't make the battle go away, you simply force it to be fought throughout the entire article rather than in a single section. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mWikiant: Also, I disagree that we're back to square one. These last months have brought into clear focus what the issue precisely is: (1) the ABA recommends that the JD be considered equivalent to a Ph.D., (2) in academia, the Ph.D. represents the highest educational level in a discipline, (3) in academia, the SJD/JSD represents the highest educational level in law. Reliable citations all around. End of story. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mSawagner201: As usual, Wikiant is incorrect.  (1) The PhD is not synonymous with "academia," and is but only one degree therein;  (2) The PhD is not the highest degree one can earn (see, for example, higher doctorates); (3) The JD is the highest degree in Law; the SJD is a degree in Juridical Science/Jurisprudence, not Law, and the LLM is in Laws, derived from the latin Legum, referring to specific Laws, not the collective concept of Law (a cite on Georgetown University, I believe previously incldued in this article, discusses that); the citations you have used have been presented in a misleading fashion; they often do not specifically mention the JD, but are talking about professional doctorates generally.  Furthermore, academia is more than just the PhD granting schools at a university.  For example, the highest degree awarded by most law schools is the JD, and this is precisely the degree that qualifies one to be a professor at a law school.  This debate will never go away as long as your push misleading edits. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH6: Refutation
[36mJJL: The Ph.D., meaning "Teacher of Philosophy", is surely closely identified with the very nature of academe. It is the highest degree one can earn in the U.S.at least, there are none higher. The J.D. is unequivocally ''not'' the highest degree in law; you're making up a distinction that doesn't exist (and recall that foreign-trained lawyers, for example, can sometimes use an American LL.M. as their degree to allow them to practice law here). Furthermore, we've produced a long list of citations that address the J.D. in particular as being a professional doctorate accorded lower status than the M.D. (Mwenda and muuka, the differential treatment by the military, the U. of Michigan statement, etc.). The M.F.A. is often the highest degree given in certain artistic fields and qualifies one to be a professor in those fieldsit's a terminal degreebut the D.F.A. exists, is offered by some schools, and is higher. I'm taken aback by how you can claim to see things in the way you indicate. It's simply contrary to what sources have been adduced. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mRmcsamson: On (1) Yes. (2) Most of the higher doctorates are now only given honoris causa, which means they're not really an academic qualification that one uses together with degrees actually studied for. (3) I have absolutely no idea where you get this distinction other than the translations of the degree names from Latin, and agree with JJL on this point. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[35mSk75: I think you may be overstating the evidence that the JD is accorded a "lower" status than the MD.  (I remain skeptical of the very notion that one doctoral degree can have a lower or higher position than the others although certainly people hold varying opinions, particularly based on the duration of the programs, about the rigor and value of those degrees.)
First, none of the military citations I've read indicate that any difference in the treatment of doctors and lawyers in the U.S. armed services are attributable to the degree itself rather than the profession they practice in the armed forces.
Second, I think that the Mwenda source actually suggests that the MD cannot properly be viewed as any kind of doctorate. It quotes from another source (Phillips and Pugh) that suggests the MD is a bachelor's degree: "[G]eneral medical practitioners are given the honorary title of Doctor although they do not have a doctorate from their universities. Indeed, on the basis of their university course they are credited with two bachelor's degrees..." (90). (It's not even clear to me that Mwenda is referring to the American academia in this statement.) Mwenda also apparently regards the JD as a kind of second-entry bachelor's degree: "[T]he U.S. law degree program is neither a master's degree nor a doctorate" (87). In Mwenda's worldview, as I read it, the only kind of doctorate is the PhD and other dissertation doctorates. I suggest that this is a fringe viewpoint when describing American higher ed. Indeed, on pages 89-90, Mwenda states that "most professional doctorates, unlike a JD, have both taught and research components, culminating in the presentation of a thesis or dissertation," and Mwenda cites the DBA and DEng degrees as proper professional doctorates. The Wikipedia pages on the DBA and DEng describes them as a research doctorates. Thus, while I understand Mwenda's point, I view it as (1) an argument for how the author thinks things ought to be conceptualized and (2) contrary to the consensus view of professional doctorates in the United States.
Third, the U. Michigan statement was simply that the JD is not the same as a traditional higher-ed doctorate, like the Ph.D. I understand that statement to mean the JD is not a research doctorate, which I think we all agree on. I don't read it as saying the JD is inferior to the PhD. And I don't see how it relates at all to the MD.
Also, I think you dismiss Sawagner201's point too quickly. Even the Mwenda source describes some evidence that the LLM and SJD degrees are "'illegitimate' children" in the family of law degrees (93). Mwenda notes that the LLM and SJD degrees "do not attract much professional respect or recognition from many quarters of the U.S. legal profession" (93), and, indeed, at the Cornell Law School "in exceptional cases" a JSD or LLM candidate can transfer to the JD program. Mwenda condemns the whole system as "illogical" (95). However they are regarded, I am not convinced they can be seen as "higher" degrees in a "vertical" progression with the JD at the base of the progression.
For those editors who wish to view the Mwenda source directly, it is accessible at bit(dot)ly/b4F4qq. After reading it over again, I wonder if this source is a "questionable source" under Wikipedia's rules because the views it expresses are "widely acknowledged as extremist" (such as the MD is not any kind of doctorate) and "rel[ies] heavily on rumors and personal opinions." Look, for instance at how Mwenda quotes extensively on page 91 from a blog post on one lawyer's blog. I'm not sure it crosses the line into "questionable" territory, but for me it comes close. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[36mJJL: You direct me to pg. 90 of M&M...the; very first sentence is "Getting back to the case of the United Kingdom." In the U.K., would-be physicians receive two bachelor's degrees (see MBBS) and are accorded the courtesy title 'Doctor' despite not having a doctorate. It's a completely different system. Quoting Wikipedia as a source on the DBA and DEng degrees isn't helpful. As to the question of whether the J.D.>LL.M.>S.J.D. progression is legitimate or not, given that that's the order of prerequisites I'd need to see a source rather than a WP:SYNTH here. The U. of M. statement seems clear enough to me. To suggest that M&M; expresses "extremist" views in the context of all the other material advanced that aligns with those views is to simply dismiss an entire side of this debate. In any event, Mwenda's academic work is clearly a preferred source in the context of WP:RS. In any event, let's be clear: The M.D. is not always accorded the same status as is the Ph.D., but both are accorded higher status than the J.D.
Things are really moving in the wrong direction here. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[33m76.21.212.171: @Sawagner201  The Phd is the highest degree earned in the United states... End of story. The JD is not the highest degree that can be earned in law; the JD is nothing more than an LLB masquerading as a so-called professional doctorate. If I ever meet a lawyer with a JD, who requests to be addressed as ‚ÄúDr‚Äù, I will laugh straight at their face.  Also, the ABA is an accreditation group of lawyers; to have the ABA declare that the JD is equivalent to the PhD lol, is like having a bunch of monkeys claiming to be humans.

I suggest you take your ass and get a ‚Äúreal‚Äù doctorate degree ‚Ä¶.loser lol.  ‚ÄîPreceding unsigned comment added by rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH0: Name calling/hostility, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[37mZoticogrillo: The US developed a unique system of professional programs of study (law, medicine, business, etc) that is separate from the research or "academic" programs. It was originally believed in other countries that professional skills should only be taught in the field, through apprenticeships for example, and that all universities teach only academic theory and research.  This perspective changed in the US, and the JD and MD were born.  That has started to change outside the US, but the change is fairly recent and usually only adopted piece-meal.  The JD is a professional degree, not a research degree, and is the terminal professional degree in the field of law.  I hope that my citations clarifying this haven't been removed, but I'm having a hard time finding them, which is a shame, because they added a great deal of clarity. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mWikiant: We seem to agree that the SJD is a research (i.e., academic) degree. The fact that the JD is a prerequisite for the LLM and (in turn) for the SJD indicates that the JD is indeed not separate from academic programs. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mRmcsamson: I actually fail to see how the J.D. is NOT an academic program. It's not a research-oriented program (even if J.D. students are trained in some form of legal research), but it's an academic program. I thought that was pretty obvious. Hahaha. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mJJL: The distinction is between academic degrees like the M.A. and professional degrees like the M.F.A. In a broad sense both are degrees from an academy of higher learning and hence are 'academic degrees' but when used more narrowly they separate a professional degree like the J.D. from a (purely) academic degree like the S.J.D. that isn't intended to prepare a person for a profession.
The current wordingimplying that the distinctions made w.r.t. the J.D. are the same as for any other professional degreeisn't what we've been trying to address here and is weaker than what's in the sources. It sidesteps, rather than addresses, the reason for having this section. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[37mZoticogrillo: Let's allow for variations in usage of English internationally: The term "academic" in this context is used differently in the U.S. than in commonwealth countries.  Let's just use the term "research," and remember that the U.S. is not a commonwealth country nor a part of the "Oxbridge" system.  Comparing the J.D. to a research degree is like comparing apples and oranges.  Now, who erased those citations?  In fact, there are a whole TON of citations that have been thrown to the windcitations from both sides of the issue.  We should really try and include all interesting material relevant to the article, regardless of our opinions.  Again, those citations that explain the differences in the U.S. between research degrees and professional degrees to non-U.S. readers are particularly useful.  Wikiant's reasoning that all elements in a series must be of the same type is flawed (i.e. that the JD is not a separate academic program because it is a prerequisite for research degrees). rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[37mZoticogrillo: btw, re-reading the section in question: Duh!  It's obvious: Because they are both reseach doctorates!  One in law, the other in philosophy.    I mean, the last sentence, saying that the SJD is equiv to the PhD. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mWikiant: At least with respect to the JD, the division between professional and research degrees raises two troubling issues. (1) Based on your repeated emphasis that "doctor is latin for teacher," since the point of the JD is to prepare one to practice law, not teach law, the JD is not a "doctorate". (2) The application of "doctor" as an indicator of the JD being terminal relies on an arbitrary and artificial distinction. The body of knowledge required for the practice of law is a subset of the body of knowledge required for the research of law. I can make similar arbitrary distinctions to show that the MBA is a terminal degree. For that matter, one can argue that a high school diploma is terminal for the practice of a trade. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[37mZoticogrillo: That's interesting.  However, there is still a division between professional and research doctorates in the U.S., and it's not my idea.  Please research the issue more, using the citations I provided in previous versions of the article and the archived discussions. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mRmcsamson: Actually, there's something to be said about this. If "doctor" is latin for teacher, then "juris doctor" means "teacher of the law/jurisprudence" (no need to get technical on the meaning of law vs. jurisprudence at this point). I agree that the J.D. is meant to prepare one to practice law. But the J.D. also suffices as adequate training to allow someone to actually teach law. Having an LLM and an SJD will probably be indicative of better training as an academic researcher, but in terms of teaching law, especially teaching in the sense that the classes taught prepare a student for legal practice? The J.D. seems rather adequate. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mDeep Purple Dreams: I should also note that a J.D. seems to be sufficient to teach law. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32m67.182.112.70: The Phd is the highest degree earned in the United states. End of story. Really? It can be logically argued that the J.S.D. "is the highest degree earned in the United States."
[T]the JD is not the highest degree that can be earned in law. But that is also true of the D.D.S./D.M.D. (The Juris Doctor resembles the D.D.S./D.M.D., which is the prerequisite for the Master of Dental Science (M.S.D.), making the M.S.D. the terminal academic degree in dentistry.)
[T]he JD is nothing more than an LLB masquerading as a so-called professional doctorate. It can be logically argued that this is also true of the D.D.S./D.M.D.
If I ever meet a lawyer with a JD, who requests to be addressed as ‚ÄúDr‚Äù, I will laugh straight at their face. It is immodest and rude for any degree holder to make such a request. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
