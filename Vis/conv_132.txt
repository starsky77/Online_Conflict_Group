{'text': 'Here we go. You and your assumptions. You are assuming that i am making "excuses" for this Chai Vang. Glad to know how you can remain ignorant. I am truthfully speaking for the greater good of this article to make it have a neutral tone without bias. Why don\'t you read Wikipedia\'s rule or neutrality. You would benefit from it since you dont seem to understand Wikipedia rules. You can see in the talk page of this article, there are a couple of editors who also feel that this article is biased. I already have pointed to specifics of details that should be included and that this article should be rewritten to maintain a neutral point of view. For example: for the aftermath, Vang\'s home was burned down as a sort of retaliation and result of the shooting and signs were made to Save a Deer, Shoot a Hmong. These are important details that need to be in this article because of it\'s significance and impact of this case. I am not excusing murder but I am not also excusing racism/bullying either. You seem to be acknowledging racism and bullying as long as it isn\'t murder which means you have an agenda of keeping this a misleading biased article. I suggest again, that you need to make the appropriate changes to this article. Your biased and racist colors are starting to show.  As for Peg Lautenschlager, since her name was mentioned and part of her tactic questions were briefly mentioned in this article that had no bearing on the subject in this article, a brief history on the Attorney General is pretty relevant in this article. I bet you an apology that the majority of the community would agree that this article is biased with a blend of racism.', 'username': 'Lance616168', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument', 'DH0: Name calling/hostility', 'DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}

The sources I referenced, most are from the news website itself. The facts are true so why don\'t you do some research on some of my suggestions to see if it is or not.

{'text': 'Of course you haven\'t denied that the murderer and the victims had different ethnicity. What you are denying is that racial issues wasn\'t a "significant" factor in this case. What\'s unique about this case was that the victims decided to pursue the murderer with 8 people on ATV\'s to confront him again with hostility and who knows what other malicious intent, call him names also saying his race, threaten to beat him and then block the murderer from leaving when he tried to walk away. That is false imprisonment, assault, harassment, hate crime and attempt of assault to do great bodily harm. Don\'t you agree? If you think about it from Vang\'s point of view, you apologized for being on their land and just want to leave without any problems, then you have 8 people who just followed you on ATVs and confronted you again with hostility, they\'re angry and swearing at you calling you racial slurs, one of them just said that he was going to beat you up, and then you try to walk away but another person stepped in your way and blocked you from leaving. Also taking into account that you are smaller, surrounded in the woods and who knows how far from civilization. I\'d bet that majority of the people would agree that the murderer was quite threatened. Seems that a case like this doesn\'t happen everyday contradicting your statement that this happens everyday to people of every race. Now, back to changes for the article.\nFor the reaction part of the article: I suggest to be added that there is a sort of culture clash between land owners and trespassors of different ethnic backgrounds. Such as Hmongs or ethnic minorities trespassing and hostile/malicious behaviors towards trespassers for example. Another thing to add is that many in the community doesn\'t believe that race wasn\'t a factor and the Attorney General downplayed the racial angle in court but the Hmong community still felt that racism was a factor in the shooting.  Another reaction to add is that bumper stickers were made and sold in shops saying Save a Deer, Shoot a Hmong and that  Vang\'s home was burned down in a suspicious fire and it is speculated that it was arson because of the profane graffiti defacing Vang\'s home.\nFor the investigation section: It should be explained in the beginning of the section that after Vang apologized for being on their land and was leaving, the 8 victims pursued Vang on ATV\'s and confronted him again with a very heated atmosphere unlike the first confrontation. The facts after the heated second confrontation is what was in dispute that led to the shootings. " On the stand Hesebeck admitted Robert Crotteau had called Vang a \'Hmong ahole." It should be added following that sentence that, Lauren Hesebeck shortly after the shooting told investigators that Robert Crotteau had threatened Vang that he was going to give Vang a beating, called Vang derogatory names tagged with Hmong, and Joey Crotteau stepped in Vang\'s way blocking Vang from trying to walk away.', 'username': 'Drcrazy102', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}

The supposed "threat" was "I said, \'No, he said, you keep it up I\'m going to kick your ass. \'\'\'Better yet, just get out of here\'\'\'," Hesebeck testified. (emphasis added). In other words "if you don\'t leave, I\'m going to kick your ass...so just leave", no implication of immediately impending physical violence at all. Also, directly from your own source: "Joey \'\'\'may\'\'\' have stepped \'\'\'somewhat\'\'\' in the way when Vang was trying to leave, \'\'\'but that there was plenty of room in a clearing there for Vang to go around\'\'\'."

{'text': 'The sources does "back up" what i claimed happened. You really are ignorant of the details in this case. Are you not aware that Chai Vang was chased by the victims to be confronted again? The first time was when Vang was confronted at the deer stand. Vang was showed the directions out and Vang walked away after apologizing for being on their land. The victims stated it themselves on the stand in court. The second confrontation happened when the victims pursed Vang on ATV\'s and caught up to him and surrounded him. If you think that me or the VICTIMS are lying now, please look it up or watch the documentary to see the recordings of the victims Lauren Hesebeck and Terry Willers saying it themselves.  But just in case if you don\'t look it up or watch the documentary, here\'s the proof for you.  I don\'t know why there\'s someone like you editing this article without knowledge of all the details of this case. You can even look at a small part of it in the article. This article made no mention of Vang being followed which it SHOULD have but it does say this in the shooting section. " Upon receiving a response in the negative, he began to approach Vang and told him to leave the property. After asking for directions, Vang proceeded to walk away towards a trail through a forested area of the property. At that point five of the hunters from the cabin who had heard the radio message arrived on ATVs." Seems like this article needs some serious editing to include all the information. This whole sentence should be rewritten to have a more detailed explanation that when the rest of the party arrived on ATV\'s, Robert Crotteau wanted to "talk" to Vang so they all decided to go intercept Vang. Now about Joey Crotteau blocking Vang from leaving, IT DID HAPPEN. Please look at the source above that i put for you in this paragraph.  I do agree with you that this source  is an opinion concerning the fact that it said " There was plenty of more room for Vang to go around." That\'s pretty biased. Now to your false "claim" that bumper stickers saying Save a Deer, Shoot a Hmong and Vang\'s house burning down was not relevant to the case. Sure it\'s not relevant that Vang shot people and is a murderer but it is RELEVANT to the reaction section in the article. By your logic since those reactions aren\'t relevant to Vang shooting people or him being a murderer, the rest of the article is irrelevant as well. All except for Vang shooting 8 people killing 6, injuring 2 and is a convicted murderer. It seems that you have failed to refute my "claims" which unfortunately for you was all TRUE.

The term "Mud Duck" is often used in Western Wisconsin to refer to Minnesota residents, similar to "Cheesehead" being used to describe Wisconsin residents. Willers used this term to describe Chai Vang when he radioed back to the cabin. The term has no racial connotation, although the defense claimed it did. While it is unknown how Willers and the others knew that Vang was from Minnesota, the state is well known for having the largest population of Hmong in the United States.\'\'" is changed to "\'\'Hesebeck admitted that he told law enforcement that Robert Crotteau had problems with trespassers in the past, specifically citing Hmong hunters. \'\'\'{paragraph break} Days after the shooting, Hesebeck told investigators that Robert Crotteau had called Vang deragotary  names tagged with Hmong along with threats that he was going to administer Vang a beating.
