{'text': "Adding a few notes:\nThis article is under WikiProject UK geography (amongst others) with Wikipedia:WikiProject UK geography/How to write about settlements#Geography relevant\nA list of (current) weather stations here [].  The nearest to Selsey is Bognor.  Guidence seems to be to use Template:Climate chart (however use of Template:Weather box seems quite prevalent.\nFrom a quick glance round the practice for local coastal resorts without a weather stations does appear to be not to published climate tables. Worthing is a similar 'B-Class' article with an approach similar to that for Selsey (without the climate table).\nThe climate data will usually be available at the next regional level up (usually county), in this case West Sussex, though Hampshire takes a different (possible better) approach showing a spread of results from weather stations.  Interestingly the 'See also' goes to the UK climate article skipping the county section article.\nThe case for the climate tables are that visitors intending to Holiday to Selsey and checking Wikipedia might be interested in the climate data\nI believe the climate table contributor would indicate the data is properly sourced on the basis of the 5km grid data published from the Met Office.  I have only a hazy understanding of how this works but is apparently interpolates between weather stations and is supplemented by other sources and they are fairly confident most spurious readings have been eliminated.", 'username': 'Djm-leighpark', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Contextualisation']}

{'text': 'I my experiance consensus is that covering climate is best done at county level. Unless there is an official weather station in the settlement the data is going to be extrapolated and not verifiable in such fine detail. Local factors can not be factored in with certainty. Such a mass of detail is probably undue for an encyclopedia article on a settlement. If we use anything I would favour the climate chart because it conveys sufficient information for the average reader in an easily digestible form.\nThere is also the question of original research as the data is copied from a primary source database, and one that requires login.\nAs to informing visitors Wikipedia is not a travel guide. We have Wikivoyage for that function, and that can be linked to. In this country the weather we actually get has little relation to averages anyway.', 'username': 'Charlesdrakew', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
{'text': "The main climate points about Selsey is that it is in the sunniest part of the UK and  in a tornado hotspot ('The Isle of Wight and South Coast Anomaly'), the article now provides that information. The citations include links to quite comprehensive Met office  climate tables for Selsey. The weather detail on the West Sussex page is quite limited, hence the See Also to the UK Climate page.  I think the section now works with or without the climate tables.

{'text': 'The current version without a weather box seems to be going in the right direction by using text and cited sources. One advantage of Wikipedia is the ease of linking information. Just because the Met Office do a synthesis of data does not mean we need to use it in all settlements a few miles apart giving it undue weight. Wikilink(s) to the appropriate regional level or nearest weather station site article would hit the mark. Introducing material with an unsustainable maintenance requirement does not seem a good idea.

{'text': 'I am open to having a discussion about the weather box. What I do not agree is that the weather box must not be included until we reach a consensus. I added the data back in the Autumn and added the record highs and lows in the following months, until recently all of that data has gone unchallenged. Soon as the weather box was there before this dispute had begun, then arguably it should remain in place until we reach a consensus. The primary reason I added the weather box was because Selsey is located in the sunniest grid square of the UK according to the Met Office. So because of this, a climate chart will not do as it does not display the sunshine hours. Selsey does not have significantly different weather to most other parts of the UK with the exception of its sunshine totals.', 'username': '10 December 2017', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits', 'Providing clarification']}
