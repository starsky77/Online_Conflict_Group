{'text': 'There are three sources cited for the claim in the infobox that it was a "tactical victory" for the UN (US):\nQuigley (not a professional historian) describes it as "an epic, born out of disaster, in a series of brilliant, hardfought tactical victories, while at the same time for the Army\'s Tenth Corps and Macarthur\'s HQ in Tokyo, it was a crushing strategic defeat" (the \'\'Foreword\'\').\nEdwards, discussing the \'\'perception\'\' of the battle, asks, "How has this event become a tactical victory for the Marines and a disgraceful loss for the army that was fighting next to them?" (p 67). Elsewhere he says that the retreat was a "masterpiece of military stupidity and unpreparedness that has somehow become tragically heroic" (p 64), the "greatest defeat and rout of military forces in American history" (p 65). Citing this source is cherrypicking in the extreme.\nCowley - I cannot access it via Google Books.\nLooking at other sources:\nBruce Cumings, one of the leading American historians of Korea, describes it as a "terrible defeat" (\'\'Korea\'s Place in the Sun\'\', p 280).\nThe National Museum of the US Army describes it as a "nightmare".\nRoy Appleman, American military historian, says, "Its hallmarks were misery, soul-crushing cold, privation, exhaustion, heroism, sacrifice, leadership of high merit at times, but finally, unit and individual disaster... It would be hard to find a more nearly hopeless or more tragic story in American military history" .\nI accept that (a) the US soldiers fought well (at times), (b) they inflicted heavy losses on the other side (perhaps), (c) they frustrated some of the strategic goals of the other side (perhaps), and (d) some of them managed to retreat to South Korea. But these things are true in many defeats. They don\'t stop this being a defeat for the US. This shouldn\'t be a jingoistic American propaganda piece.

In summary, my thoughts are:\nIs it a strategic victory for the Chinese? IMO it is not per citation 1, if the one of the main result of this battle is Chinese got defeated and chased out of South Korea after Jan 1951.\nIs it a operational/tactical victory for the Chinese? IMO it is a bit half and half...to play devil\'s advocate, does it count as a win if your entire army turned into a "field hospital" for three months and the enemy only yield ground due to situations on the other side of Korean peninsula?\nif it is not a clear cut strategic or tactical win for the Chinese side, then what is this victory should be called?\nAlthough I do agree with one point with , I definitely think it is grossly inaccurate to describe this battle as some kind of "UN victory".', 'username': 'Jim101', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}

Alternatively we can go with what  wrote here (which is to describe the result of the battle as "Disputed") but FTR I think that it\'s one of those rare cases where it\'s better to not mention the result so as to keep the wording as neutral as possible and just let the reader decide. Some of the sources describe the outcome of the battle specifically as a "UN tactical victory" or "Chinese strategic victory" but like you said they don\'t represent the consensus position on the issue.
