{'text': 'Numerous empirical studies have found that, among other beneficial effects, economic freedom promotes economic growth and poverty reduction. I\'m concerned about this line for two reasons. First of all, the subject is "numerous empirical studies," but there\'s only one citation. Secondly and more importantly, it is non-neutral and overly simplified; it represents a point of view.', 'username': 'Mohawkjohn', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
{'text': 'Source (OECD yearbook) says: "Ongoing work, by those involved in the economic freedom project and outside researchers, shows that economic freedom promotes economic growth and poverty reduction. These findings are now relatively uncontroversial and have been published in leeding peer-reviewed journals, such as the \'\'American Economic Review\'\'." Listing number of studies and then saying "numerous studies say..." could be classified as original research, this is not. It doesnâ€™t represent a point of view. Studies have really shown that economic freedom promotes economic growth and poverty reduction, that is a matter of fact, not of opinion.', 'username': 'Vision Thing', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'Perhaps you could qualify the statement? Economic freedom MAY promote economic growth and poverty reduction, perhaps. For example, economic freedom for American coffee companies could promote American economic growth and poverty reductionbut what about in Central American countries? It might increase poverty there as well. The point is that it all depends upon how you define/qualify economic freedom. Thus, oversimplification.', 'username': 'Mohawkjohn', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'If the general economic freedom increases in the USA, incomes of American consumers increase and they will buy more high quality coffee and so incomes of Central American farmers would increase. Economic freedom for American coffee companies is just too narrow concept, please look at the broader picture.', 'username': 'Doopdoop', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'The OECD yearbook isn\'t a very good source. It has a "a series of commentaries from leading figures in policy, business, labour, research and civil society". The reference in question is in a commentary by FredMcMahon, from the Fraser Institute, who is clearly not a neutral source. And the commentary itself doesn\'t mention any specific articles, just that studies have been published. I don\'t doubt it\'s true, but this source isn\'t a great one.', 'username': 'Cretog8', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}
