[31mBakaso: NPOV rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mBakaso: I added the NPOV template, because the article was written exactly be the people whose ideology is derived from teachings of the Frankfurt school. They also used only their own obscure and extremist sources, for example by the SPLC, which is an anti-white Jewish hate group. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mCoffeepusher: I am removing the NPOV tag because you are not proposing any actionable items.  Where is the article lacking in "representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without bias, all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic?" Simply stating that the article is written using reliable sources you don't like isn't enough, what sources need to be incorporated? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mBakaso: It's not that I don't like the sources, I don't like the authors who wrote them, because they're the ones who created this claim about a "conspiracy theory". This article is NPOV, because it doesn't say it was created by them and instead presents it as a real conspiracy theory, where most people agree on the fact that it's implausible. This is a clever ruse on the part of the neo-marxists and an attempt to deny the fact that their teachings indeed originate in the Frankfurt school. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mCoffeepusher: please read wikipedia's sourcing policy, WP:FRINGE, and wikipedia's neutral point of view policy.  The tag is inappropriate, because you are not complaining that the sourcing is wrong, or proposing additional reliable sources.  Not liking the page, or agreeing with the view is not enough on wikipedia, and the WP:NPOV tag is inappropriate if you aren't going to actually engage with the npov policy, which is directly about sourcing. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mBakaso: No, it's about the way the sources are cited. The Wikipedians want to make people think that this is a fact, so they cite extremist literature without properly ascribing the sources to the authors. For example the one I corrected: nowhere did it say that Martin Jay is in fact a prominent neo-marxist and a critical theory expert. Wikipedia requires this, because else anyone could create a completely false article based on fringe extremist literature. So it's you who should read up about Wikipedia's sourcing policy and fringe sources. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mCoffeepusher: so it's you who should read up about Wikipedia's sourcing policy and fringe sources I've asked you a few times to cite the sources you have a problem with, so what are they? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mCoffeepusher: and you are correct that this is documenting a WP:FRINGE view, please read WP:NFRINGE and the article for deletion page for this article. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mBakaso: I have a problem with almost every source in the article, because as I said, they're improperly cited. There should be such phrases like "according to proponents of this theory", "according to a neo-marxist professor X" etc. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mCoffeepusher: they are cited according to the WP:MOS.  Giving bibliographical information within the text of sourcing is not in accordance to wikipedia's policy, and you are only required to name the author of the reference if you are giving a full sentence quote, and no biblographical information is required.  Additionally, according to reliable sources there exists a conspiracy theory that is documented in this paper.  It hasn't been manufactured by anyone, it exists and is documented in reliable peer reviewed sources.  Since your issue is that the citations do not have the bibliographical information of the source authors, and this is not in violation of wikipedia's manual of style or NPOV policy, I am removing the NPOV tag again unless you can give me a wikipedia policy that says the article is incorrectly cited. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mCoffeepusher: Now we can continue discussing if more bibliographical information is appropriate, but that isn't a NPOV issue, so replacing the tag is inappropriate. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mBakaso: You're trying to pretend you don't understand my comments, but seeing you're a communist and a neo-marxist yourself, this tactic is perhaps understandable. WP:NPOV clearly says: Avoid stating opinions as facts. Which is what's happening in this article, the claims in the sources are passed off as facts. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Repeated argument
[31mBakaso: '"Usually, articles will contain information about the significant opinions that have been expressed about their subjects. However, these opinions should not be stated in Wikipedia's voice. Rather, they should be attributed in the text to particular sources, or where justified, described as widespread views, etc. For example, an article should not state that "genocide is an evil action", but it may state that "genocide has been described by John X as the epitome of human evil."'' rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mCoffeepusher: What extremist sources are you referring to?  Every source on this page passes WP:RS, is written in the voice of those sources, and fuflills weight. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34m190.141.142.209: SPLC has been described by some as extremist. And it's written in the voice of the sources without stating so, which is the problem. For example the lead should read: Frankfurt School conspiracy theory is an alleged conspiracy theory, which according to some left-wing activists originated with a 1992 essay in a Lyndon LaRouche movement journal. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mCoffeepusher: SPLC is a reliable source for wikipedia, and while "some" may consider it extremist, wikipedia considers it reliable.  Do you have any sources within this text that would be considered unreliable and extremist by wikipedia's standards since that is what you need to prove to maintain the NPOV tag. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mCoffeepusher: This discussion has been mentioned at WP:ANI#new user at Frankfurt School conspiracy theory, as well as the WP:RSN#Frankfurt School conspiracy theory "extremest sources". rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mJzG: Given the rather obvious lack of any widespread acceptance of the idea that this is an NPOV issue, I removed the template. WP:BRD applied. The "D" part has conspicuously failed to support the "B" part, so the "R" part wins...  () rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
