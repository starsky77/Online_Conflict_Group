[31mFakirbakir: A great deal of this territory and its settlers subsequently became the western edge of Rus' principality at the start of the 9th century
This territory did not belong to the Rus around 800. There is no reliable source about it.
Prince Laborec fell from power under the efforts of the Hungarians and the Kievan forces
Prince Laborec was a fictive person. There is no reliable source about it.
Local Ruthenian nobility often intermarried with the Hungarian nobles to the south.
Local Ruthenian nobility in Carpathian Ruthenia around 1000? And this group intermarried with Hungarian nobles? There is no reliable source about it. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mPANONIAN: Well, Fakirbakir, I do not see that you provided any source for any of your own claims. Do you have any source that can confirm your statements? Anyway, here is evidence that Carpathian Ruthenia was part of Kievan Rus: http://faculty.unlv.edu/pwerth/Kievan-Rus'-11thcent.jpg And here are also numerous sources about Prince Laborec: . rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mFakirbakir: Your source did not mention that Carpathian Ruthenia belonged to the Rus in the 9th century. Moreover Prince Laborec is a fictive legendary person, written by Anatolij Kralickij (in 1863). rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mFakirbakir: Source about "Prince Laborec" rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mFakirbakir: Prince Laborec is a tale, the Kievian Rus was established in !!882!! and before that the Novgorodian Rus did not have any influence on this territory. So, the Rus in Carpathian Ruthenia at the start of 9th century is not correct. Moreover the Hungarian Etelk√∂z (today south/southwest Ukraine, Moldova) was the eastern neighbour of Carpathian Ruthenia in the 9th century. The descendants of White Croat nobles could have intermarried with Hungarian nobles, but Ruthenian nobles could not, because there was no such a thing as "Ruthenian nobles" in the 9/10 th centuries in Carpathian Ruthenia. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mPANONIAN: I disagree with your interpretation. Firstly, we cannot conclude from this source that prince Laborec was not real person. I do not even think that term "historical tale" is an correct English translation of "istoryƒçna povist". "povist" is general Slavic word for "story", no matter if that story is real or invented. In modern Croatian "povijest" means simply "history". Furthermore, here we have two additional sources that speaking about Prince Laborec like about real person: , . As for the Carpathian Ruthenia in the 9th century and Ruthenian nobles, I will investigate this issue further, but, you still did not provided sources that saying that these two statements are incorrect. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation, DH4: Repeated argument
[31mFakirbakir: I think Ruthenian nobles (alias nobles of Rus) intermarried with Hungarian nobles, but that is a latter effect, it started probably from the 11th century. I did read somewhere that Hungarian chiefs had Varangian bodyguards in the 10th century and they could have been "Ruthenian nobles", however the Varangians did not belong to Carpathian Ruthenia. They were simple mercenaries from North. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mPANONIAN: Well, I changed term to "Slavic nobility" since some of them indeed might be White Croats. Is that OK to you? Do you consider anything else disputed? rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mFakirbakir: It is much better now. Actually Prince Laborec is still dubious to me, I will add different opinions about it. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
