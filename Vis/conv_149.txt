{'text': 'As another editor pointed out already. The discussion is beyond silly.\nLast week Zac was putting Ophiuchus (astrology) up for deletion, arguing that there shouldn\'t be an article about it.\nNow that the article was kept, it is not enough to have an article about it, Zac insists that two other articles need sections about it. A hatnote link to Ophiuchus (astrology) is not sufficient. Does this editor know what he wants?\nThe difference between the "astronomical zodiac" and "astrological zodiac" is clearly explained in Zodiac, and is equal to the definition that  just brought from another source.\nOphiuchus is one of the 88 modern constellations, and that\'s all. And astronomers are not confused about it.\nWhatever mumbo-jumbo some astrologers have dreamt up about Ophiuchus has its own space in Ophiuchus (astrology). The astrology of Ophiuchus is not that notable, it is only a rather recent fringe theory within astrology. So it is more than enough to link it from the hatnote here. It is not that important that it needs sections in several other articles.', 'username': 'MakeSense64', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Contextualisation']}

{'text': 'Sorry if my replies were not clear enough - let me restate the situation here, so my points are perfectly lucid.\nThere is no difference between the "astronomical zodiac" and "astrological zodiac" - these are one and the same. As soon as you use the word \'zodiac\' you are talking about the division of celestial longitude into twelve equal divisions of 30° each. You can talk about constellations that \'\'cross\'\' the zodiac, but you cannot talk about constellations that \'\'make\'\' the zodiac because the zodiac is only made of mathematical divisions, which begin with the first point of Aries. It is therefore not an \'\'astrological\'\' discussion to explain how many signs of the zodiac there are, and why Ophiuchus is not one of these. This matter does not need reference to an astrological section or an astrological page, because it is a matter of astronomical definition, and has been so for over 2500 years. Whether astronomers are confused or not, the general public are, and so will expect this page to give some kind of reliable explanation. The content that covers this issue is brief, reliable and factual and - although this has escaped your notice - does not make any astrological reference. (As a reminder, it reads as follows:)\nBecause of the partial overlap of the constellation Ophiuchus and the Sun\'s path upon which zodiacal longitude is based, Ophiuchus is sometimes mistakenly referred to as the \'13th sign of the zodiac\'. This is an innapropriate reference since the zodiac is a division of the ecliptic into twelve equal parts, initially originated for calendrical purposes. This makes the notion of a \'13th sign\' a mathematical impossibility. It is only correct to refer to Ophiuchus as one of the constellations which cross the zodiac; which does not constitute a zodiacal sign, of which all historical records acknowledge only twelve.[16]', 'username': 'Zachariel', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'The lede on Zodiac disagrees with you. Quoting:\n\'In astronomy , the zodiac (Greek: ζῳδιακός, zōdiakos) is the ring of constellations that lines the ecliptic, which is the apparent path of the Sun across the celestial sphere over the course of the year. The paths of the Moon and planets also lie roughly within the ecliptic, and so are also within the constellations of the zodiac.\'\'\n\'In astrology, the zodiac denotes those signs that divide the ecliptic into twelve equal zones of celestial longitude.\'\'\nSo in astronomy it is the ring of \'\'\'constellations\'\'\', the 13 of them, including Ophiuchus.\nWhile in astrology it is the \'\'\'signs\'\'\' dividing the ecliptic in 12 equal zones.\nLike it or not, a clear distinction is being made. And the same distinction is made in the source that  cited.\nAlso note that Zodiac is one of the few articles that belongs both to astronomy and astrology category.\nThe section you want to bring in is completely astrological, because it clearly refers to zodiac in the astrological sense of 12 equal divisions.\nAstrological considerations about the "sign" are irrelevant here because the article starts by saying "This article is about the constellation".\nWhat is it you don\'t understand about that?', 'username': 'MakeSense64', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}
