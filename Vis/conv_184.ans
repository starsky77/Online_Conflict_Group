[31m114.143.115.163: The info-box should have an Establishment/Formation section, not merely an 'Independence' section.
The British occupation and end thereof are a miniscule portion of the history of India. 'Independence' from the British and Islamic occupations are signposts not beginnings or ends in themselves.
India as an entity has been in existence for thousands of years. It seems silly for this page to subscribe to the nonsensical notion that India is a recent construct or that it came into existence at the end of the British occupation.  â€” Preceding unsigned comment added by rebuttal_labels::

[34m114.143.116.232: If it is about the 'modern country of India' then why is there a History section that mentions 'Ancient India' and 'Medieval India'? By your logic there shouldn't be a single shred of information about anything that happened before the end of the British occupation. Governing systems, dispensations and even geography may change but the page is about the cultural and geographic entity that has been known as India for millennia. [Side note: I find it amusing that an Englishman is the presiding judge deciding on matters concerning the India page.]  â€” Preceding unsigned comment added by rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34m114.143.116.232: Also, if this page is solely about the 'Republic of India' then there cannot logically be a mention of 'independence', because it was not the present republic that gained said independence. If we are confining ourselves to the republic then surely we must state that it came into being (once again we must use the word formation) on August 15th 1947. Sticking to the logic of this page the entity that gained independence was not the current republic but that thing which preceded it.  â€” Preceding unsigned comment added by rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mMilborneOne: Nothing wrong with having information about the history before independence to put everything in context. But the present "India" in this article didnt exist before 1947 which was larger and different hence the information to put it all in context. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34m114.143.116.232: Was the People's Republic of China established in 221 BCE? Was the current Federal Republic of Germany formed in 962 CE?  â€” Preceding unsigned comment added by rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34m114.143.116.232: Like I said earlier geography and dispensations may vary but the entity in question remains unchanged. The present 'Germany' in the article on that country didn't exist in 962 did it? The India before 1947 may have been larger or smaller but it wasn't different and that is the point. This is clearly a serious matter that calls for a serious discussion and a re-think on the very nature of the India page. I think we need some higher level people involved here.  â€” Preceding unsigned comment added by rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mMilborneOne: Higher level? I think you will find eveybody is at the same level. And please dont make comments about other editors it doesnt help. Not sure why you think it is serious we have a large number of articles on the history of india and this one is about the current country called "India" it has sibling articles about other bits of what was also called India like the British Raj. Nobody is saying that the Republic of India doesnt share a common path back in time with other bits of the Indian subcontinent but this article is about the Union and the Republic of India. You are welcome to make a formal proposal for others to comment but you need to define exactly what you want to add to the infobox. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH4: Repeated argument
[34m114.143.116.232: I wasn't threatening to go over your head on anything. I just meant if this is a change that you are not authorized to perform then a higher-level editor might be called for. I would like more people joining in on this that is all. As for making myself clearer on what I want, I would request you to peruse some of the other country pages, the China and Germany ones that I mentioned for instance. It is simple fact that the 'current' Germany was not formed in 962 CE but that is what the infobox says. It is simple fact that the current China was not formed in 221 BCE but that is what the infobox says. I am sure those countries also have separate 'History of' pages - that is not the issue at hand. The point is that India, China, Germany, Russia (formed in 862 apparently) have all been in existence in one form or another for eons. The current form of these countries is just that, the current form, of entites, be they geographic, cultural, and/or ethnic that go back a long way. What a country page should do is form a thread backwards starting with the current entity, It should not regard the current entity as a standalone. Moreover what I am calling for is uniformity and the application of similar standards across all country pages. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[36mCurb Chain: I've commented on the DRN you filed but will elaborate here.
The problem is not with this page but the other pages.  Those are wrong years by your argument and I encourage you to be WP:BOLD to update/change the dates of years where the political entity formed. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34m114.143.116.232: No, I am not arguing that those dates are wrong. Of course there can be different points of view on what constituted the beginning of a nation but those dates for are more in keeping with the spirit of what I am saying. Which is that these current entities are merely the latest form of nations that have been around in one form or another for a long time. For India it might be worth considering the time of Ashoka as some sort of establishment date. Albeit that too will surely be contested with some saying it should be earlier. If for example it is decided to use 265 BCE (the Maurya Empire at its peak under Ashoka) as the date when the India that we recognize today truly came into being, then that would be the first date in the infobox and the significant subsequent periods could be mentioned under it, such as the Kushan Empire which followed the Maurya Empire, or the various Islamic ocupations, or the Maratha Empire, or the Sikh Empire, or the Company occupation, or the British occupation, etc. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[35mGuy Macon: User 114.143.116.232, I couldn't help noticing that you filed a case at WP:DRN but have not returned to join the discussion or respond to the advice given there. Would you like me to close the case? rebuttal_labels:: 
[33m114.143.119.26: I don't understand why people keep repeating the 1947 date. That the British occupation ended on that date is simple fact beyond dispute. That is not what I am arguing about. I thought I was fairly clear on what I was trying to convey, which is that 1947 does not mark the beginning of the entity known as India. As for the specific point of this article referring to the 'political entity', that is precisely why I have drawn everyone's attention to other country pages, which even though are also about current 'political entities' use ancient dates for establishment/formation. I would like to put forward the date of 265 BCE as my contribution for a possible 'first date' in the infobox. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[37mDharmadhyaksha: And do you have a RS saying that India was established in 265 BCE? Â§Â§ rebuttal_labels:: 
[33m114.143.119.26: We could use the same source(s) that establishes the extent of Ashoka's empire in the year 265 BCE. I don't think there is any doubt that Ashoka's Empire covered all of India at that time is there? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[33m114.143.119.26: Kievan Rus' was a lot smaller than modern Russia. The Holy Roman Empire was a lot larger than modern Germany. Yet anyone with the slightest knowledge and understanding of history will recognize that those two entities were precursors to modern day Russia and Germany respectively. The area that is today Pakistan (and Bangladesh) has always been a part of India. Even the Mughal occupation at its peak did not cover the southern tip of India. The notion that Ashoka's India does not qualify as India because it included present-day Pakistan is ludicrous. I have already covered the greater/lesser argument. The logic of what I am saying should be abundantly clear to any unbiased listener. It is fairly evident that what we have here is merely good old-fashioned India hatred. I believe I have sufficiently made my point. I will not press this matter any further. This issue can now be considered closed. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH-1: Bailing out
[31mFowler&fowler: ''Comment by Fowler&fowler;''' (Since this IP is forum shopping, I have to post here as well.)  This is a non-issue, mischief created and garbage dumped by an IP, who clearly doesn't have the courage to get a Wikipedia account and be responsible for his actions.  As a long-standing contributor to the India page (since 2006), I can say without hesitation, that the Republic of India, the subject of the India page, was established in 1950 after India gained independence in 1947.  There are all sorts of archaic and irredentist notions of "India."  Hindu nationalists in particular, with their notions of  Akhand Bharat ("Undivided India"), not only claim a provenance for their entity that even predates the beginning of recorded history in India, but also typically include many of India's current day neighbors in it.  As for Ashoka, the India page's ancient history section says, "The (Mauryan) empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas." So there you have it, all impeccably sourced.  What is ludicrous is that you think that a region controlled by a king, whose name was not even known to Indians until James Prinsep deciphered the Brahmi script, and who ruled some 2,300 years ago, when it took days if not months to even communicate between different regions, would have something like a modern nation state just because his edicts are found in disparate places. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH6: Refutation
[32mRegentsPark: RK, the point is that we would need a reliable source that states that India was established in whatever year and then it becomes a point worth discussing. It's not for us to become arbiters on history by discussing amongst ourselves. That said, I don't think that India is like the uni-ethnic Germany at all. India is a multi-ethnic society with many nations and overlapping histories and is more akin to Europe than it is to any single European nation. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[33m114.143.119.26: That fowler is heavily biased is fairly clear. An earlier participant had asked me what I believed should be the first date in the infobox and I had merely offered 265 BCE as my suggestion. I was not claiming it to be final in any way. It just seems like a strong candidate. If you take a look at one of my earlier comments you will see that I had guessed that others might offer even earlier dates. All I wanted was a discussion and for uniformity in the infoboxes of various countries. Fowler's warped logic seems to be that because India was under British occupation for 190 or 90 years depending on how one views the situation, it was a colony, and therefore a 'lesser' country than a Germany or a Russia which were never colonies. That is the core of his argument. It is risible, crude and not worth entertaining. Those genuinely interested in this matter should carry-on this debate about what would make a good first date in the infobox. A good way to start would be to look at other country pages and get a sense of the logic of my argument. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Repeated argument
[37mDharmadhyaksha: A good way to start would be you coming up with a date backed with reliable sources. We aren't shopping for a wedding gown here to keep trying all and then agree on one. Â§Â§ rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[33m114.143.119.26: I am trying to figure out if you are genuinely interested in the discussion or simply want to annoy all concerned. Can you not see that I have mentioned the date 265 BCE half a dozen times. As for the source for that date we could use the same source(s) that establishes beyond dispute the extent of Ashoka's Empire at its peak. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
