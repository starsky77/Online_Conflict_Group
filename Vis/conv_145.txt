Your discussion took place nearly a year ago and since then the band received legal allowance to tour as RATT and is considered RATT.  It does not matter that you consider it to not to be. Legally it is.

However, I am well aware of the fact that content is not to be edited based on people\'s opinions. It is to show the facts. And, in your \'\'\'opinion\'\'\' the 2014 version was the last \'\'\'stable\'\'\' version of RATT, which is your opinion. Not fact. What I input is the history of RATT, and the current members (Bobby Blotzer, Joshua Alan, Mitch Perry, Brad Lang, and Stacey Blades) cannot be erased from the history. True, there are still legal proceedings, but it does not matter as this is still part of fact and history and should be documented as such. You removed ALL legal references I had input to legally back up why all changes should be made. I had all of the information with the legal proceedings. And you removed all of this. This is ALL part of the history. Do you not agree this part of the history? You\'re going to arbitrarily remove the history of the last years because you don\'t like it? Or don\'t agree with it?

{'text': 'Yes, you did ask a question, but included "WTF" within that question, which was rather disrespectful. Pretty sure WP:GUIDELINES have something to say about that. Thanks for the reference to the WP:INDENT. But since I was still within the conversation in which I was replying to myself, I kept the same indent... I provided the legal documentation stating that the current lineup is the correct line up for RATT. This was decided upon in a court of law. This adheres to WP:VER, as the reference was provided to state that legal outcome. All information was kept neutral and factual, per WP:NPOV. I am not attempting to be disruptive or cause any harm. I merely stated the facts as they are and updated the page in a concise manner according to the current information as it is. I applied the updates, and there seemed to be no issues until it was converted back to the version from over a year ago, therefore basically erasing a year\'s worth of history for this band. I see above it is stated you wanted to wait until legal proceedings were complete, but there is no clue as to when this will happen, so the page should be updated to state what the current status is. Because people come here to find this information. And, as it stands now, the information is incorrect as it refers to the court date with DeMartini, but does not provide the outcome, therefore leading readers to believe there wasn\'t one, or to come to their own conclusion. This is skewed data and needs to be updated.', 'username': 'Dijares', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument', 'DH3: Policing the discussion'], 'coordination_labels': []}

I'm not sure who that user is that is making the claims of being connected to Blotzer (actually I do recall someone stating they were related to him, but I have no idea who that is - I am not related to him.).
