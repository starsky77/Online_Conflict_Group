[31mW. B. Wilson: I am dismayed that you have moved the name of the article to include the ≈Ñ character.  I have nothing against the Polish alphabet - but this is the English language Wiki, and in the English language the city is known as "Poznan", and references to the battle written in English also use "Poznan".  Ziemke and Duffy's works are examples of this.  I kindly request you move article's name to the original title.  "Battle of Pozna≈Ñ" would be good as a redirect for the occasional Polish user of the English Wiki. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mPiotrus: The name of the city is Pozna≈Ñ. When you succeed in moving it to Poznan, I promise I will support moving the battle back to battle of Poznan (1945).| rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mW. B. Wilson: Piotrus, that is disingenuous.  This is an English-language Wiki.  In English works, the city's name -is- Poznan with no characters used from other languages.  See, for example, the article Munich.  The name of the article for the city is given in its English name which makes good sense for users of an English Wiki, even though the city's residents call it ''M√ºnchen''.
Frankly, your name move is unhelpful and exactly the sort of thing that kicks off edit wars.  I've seen very fine editing on your part and find it hard to understand both your edit and your attitude in this case.
And rest assured I know the Polish name for Poznan and many other Polish locales as well.  I am no enemy of Poland.  It is simply that are some rules that make sense for an English-language Wiki, and imposing foreign language characters on article names makes little sense. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[32mPiotrus: W. B. The issue of diacritics has been discussed in the past. Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English) notes the issue is has not been resolved but there were more in favor of diacritics in titles than not. See also Wikipedia:Naming conventions (standard letters with diacritics) and note it was rejected. Finally, use of diacritics has become a standard practice over the years. If you feel strongly about it, feel free to start a WP:RM to the original title; I believe the one with diacritic is more correct.| rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mW. B. Wilson: Thanks for the suggestion.  My time here, however, is limited and I prefer not to spend it engaging Wikipedia processes in cases that in my consideration are fairly obvious.  For the same reason, I find edit wars to be wasted time.
This article may become what it will. rebuttal_labels:: DH-1: Bailing out
[32mPiotrus: Personally I consider the naming disputes a giant waste of time compared to creating content so I hope this indeed will not be a  major issue.| rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mMrg3105: Naming disputes are created by people like yourself who insist on nationalisation of English Wikipedia. This is regardless of the fact that I will still type in Poznan every time because I am not going to change the keyboard layout for every instance I need to look at a location in Poland. However, there is such a thing called History, and it is recorded regardless of personal preferences of those who try to rewrite it. If you're not taking any flack, you're not over the target. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Stating your stance
[32mPiotrus: I resent being accused of nationalism. Please mind WP:AGF and WP:NPA. Redirects where created for a reason, and we are not going to be dumbing down complex words to simple ones. I don't have √© on my keyboard, but I certainly don't mind ''caf√©''. And I don't expect you to type Pozna≈Ñ with ≈Ñ, but it is the name of the city, not Poznan. Thousands of English language publications agree. My, nationalism is on the rise, indeed.| rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH5: Counterargument
[34mMrg3105: There is no ≈Ñ in English, or caf√© for that matter. There is no need for a redirect if the title of the article is Battle of Poznan. Changing an English title into a Polish one is nationalising of the title. WP:AGF and WP:NPA have nothing to do with it! You are changing the spelling from English to Polish. What would you call it?!  If you're not taking any flack, you're not over the target. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mPiotrus: Being correct.| rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mMrg3105: But you are only correct in Polish! In English, and we are editing in English Wikipedia, you are not correct. You would also '''not''' be correct in Russian, Turkish, Hindu, and Chinese to name a few. Do you see my point? You are imposing your own POV and spelling convention on the English language users, and using redirects for which there is absolutely no need.  If you're not taking any flack, you're not over the target. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mPiotrus: Please show me a policy that this name contradicts. And WP:UE is invalid since in my post from above I have shown that the ≈Ñ version is extensively used in English. Hence it is Poznan that is the misspelling (or a Redirect from title without diacritics, to be precise). | rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mMrg3105: With all due respect Piotr, you have not shown anything! Please see here [] for use of accents in English and English words with diacritics. I also refer you to the English alphabet. If I choose to write cafe, no one is going to fault me for it in common English usage. It is just unreasonable to impose the need to have knowledge of all the different languages that use diacritics on the English language users of Wikipedia. That would be the result of what you are suggesting if applied consistently throughout the English Wikipedia projects.   If you're not taking any flack, you're not over the target. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mPiotrus: Indeed, the world is bigger then just its English speaking part. This is also why we have redirects. I don't expect most English speakers to know most diacritics. That doesn't mean they don't exist in English language. Ignorance is not an excuse.| rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mMrg3105: Are you suggesting that non-use of diacritics is a sign of ignorance?! Not one school in Australia teaches it, and I got though a university degree without using it while being taught by lecturers from six different countries! Redirects are also used for disambiguation of English events (in this case) and the tag is {{R from historic name}}. However if you see the page Wikipedia:Redirect#Alternative_names you will see the example Byzantium, Istanbul and Constantinople, and not {lang-tr|'''ƒ∞'''stanbul}  If you're not taking any flack, you're not over the target. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mMrg3105: People should familiarise themselves with the Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names). Based on this policy, the geographic names need to use naming that reflects English usage, and use during historical period.   If you're not taking any flak, you're not over the target. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mPiotrus: Indeed. And the name was Pozna≈Ñ. Hence, everything is fine.| rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mMrg3105: Indeed nothing. Please answer the following questions:
Is the editing being done in English language Wikipedia?
Does the English language have a usage for letter '''≈Ñ''' in its alphabet?
If you're not taking any flak, you're not over the target. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mPiotrus: I have answered above.| rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mMrg3105: To clarify, User_talk:Piotrus asserts that:
English users are ignorant on the use of diacritics, and in fact the English alphabet does contain letter '''≈Ñ'''.  If you're not taking any flak, you're not over the target. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mPiotrus: I have no intention to continue this discussion, particularly when you insist of misrepresenting my arguments.| rebuttal_labels:: DH-1: Bailing out, DH3: Policing the discussion
[34mMrg3105: I wish I could misrepresent your arguments Piotr, because you haven't offered any other then to suggest that I am ignorant in the use of English language. You steadfastly refuse to acknowledge that Pozna≈Ñ may have a different spelling outside of Poland, and in this case in an English language society. Would you have been so insistent if the similarity had been less apparent in another language, as in say Greek Œ†œåŒ∂ŒΩŒ±ŒΩ?  If you're not taking any flak, you're not over the target. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[36mRadomil: Well, I'm native speaker of Polish language, but it doesn't mean that I am specialist in writing foreing names in Polish. On the other hand I often use name of Pozna≈Ñ in dialogues with native English speakers. Currently the most spread form is "Pozna≈Ñ" in favor of "Poznan" and most rarely derived from German "Posen" (which is usually treated as "faux pas" if it is used in other that historical context) rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
