[31mWavesSaid: He wrote in the Prilep-Bitola dialect of the Macedonian language. He identified as Bulgarian. It's fairly clear-cut. So why try and state that from a particular POV? rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mLaveol: You are aware that his ''POV'' is quite important for an article on himself? Do you want your POV to substitute his one? ''' ''' rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mWavesSaid: Sure, but as long as it remains ''his'' POV and doesn't override academic consensus. No, we should respect Cepenkov's choice of nation. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mLaveol: And what is the academic consensus about the language that Mr Cepenkov himself spoke. Is there a text on that topic particularly? ''' ''' rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mWavesSaid: Cepenkov wrote in (and presumably spoke) the Prilep-Bitola dialect which is universally classified as Macedonian. rebuttal_labels::

[31mWavesSaid: The following are linguistic publications dealing with the Prilep dialect as Macedonian:
'"In some west-central dialects to the west of Prilep (), which border with the eastern Macedonian dialects [...]"''Pieter Muysken. From Linguistic Areas to Areal Linguistics (John Benjamins Publishing, 2008), p. 206
'"The Prilep (West-Central) dialect uses a perfect which is intermediary [...]"'' (Chapter Five: The Perfect and the Evidential, I. Macedonian)Olga M. TomiÄ‡. Balkan Sprachbund Morpho-Syntactic Features (Springer, 2006), p. 342
'"This was actually a conservative change: it restored the historical intervocalic -v- which has been lost in many Macedonian dialects, including that of Prilep [...]"''Ulrich Ammon. Annuaire international de la sociolinguistique europÃ©enne, Volume 6 (Niemeyer Max Verlag GmbH, 1992), p. 137
'"As indicated in footnote 2, the Thracian Bulgarian dialects border on the easternmost Macedonian dialects of northern [...] This is still the case in Prilep-Veles, and evidence [...]"''Sanford B. Steever, Carol A. Walker, Salikoko S. Mufwene. Papers from the Parasession on Diachronic Syntax, April 22, 1976 (Chicago Linguistic Society, 1976), p. 100
'"[...] of dialects to the west of the Vardar river, in the area roughly defined by the quadrangle Prilep-Bitola-Kicevo-Veles."''Mark J. Elson. A diachronic interpretation of Macedonian verbal morphology (E. Mellon Press, 1990), p. 174
'"The Macedonian literary language is based on the central dialects (Bitola - Veles - Prilep), but it has also liberally adopted forms from other dialects."''Ã–sten Dahl. Tense and Aspect in the Languages of Europe (Walter de Gruyter, 2000), p. 479
'"I shall take Standard Macedonian, which in this regard faithfully reflects its West Central dialectal base (Prilep-Veles-Kicevo-Brod), as exemplary of Balkan Slavic for this chapter."''Robert M. W. Dixon. Studies in Evidentiality (John Benjamins Publishing, 2003), p. 192
This one makes specific reference to the works of Cepenkov:
'"Another indication of the dominance of Turkish during this period is that out of 155 anecdotal tales in Cepenkov's (1972) nineteenth-century Macedonian collection from the Prilep region [...] in addition to these 34 tales with interlingual code switching, there are 11 tales with dialectal code switches, given that the frame is Prilep Macedonian."''Raymond Detrez, Pieter Plas. Developing Cultural Identity in the Balkans: Convergence Vs Divergence (Peter Lang, 2005), p. 27 rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mLaveol: None but the very last source mentions Cepenkov. And even if we take this as sole evidence, we still have a problem with changing the text, since it only states what it was and is now. It was once defined as Bulgarian, and defined as such by the author himself, and is now defined as ''Prilep Macedonian''. Do we need to go through the entire history of the region in this particular article? ''' ''' rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mWavesSaid: I said the Prilep-Bitola dialect was Macedonian and you asked me for a source. I provided you with seven. The Prilep-Bitola dialect did not go from being Bulgarian to Macedonian; only the name for it did. Cepenkov's use of the term "Bulgarian" only confirms this. This article is being written in the 21st century, not in Cepenkov's own time. And Cepenkov is not a linguist and even if he were, his views would be at odds with the rest of the world. No, this article is about Marko Cepenkov. There are other articles for that: ex. History of the Macedonian language. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mLaveol: I asked you for a ref that Cepenkov wrote in Macedonian. Cepenkov's views matter about the article on him. Why would we need an article on him if we were to disregard him altogether? Or do we only need things that sit us? He was well aware what he was writing and on what language. Plus, what is the problem with the text, since it states what we've been discussing?

[34mJingiby: By the way, in the lead is a sentence: ''Today, his dialect is classified as the Prilep-Bitola dialect of the Macedonian language.''{Citation needed|date=May 2011} If you wont, just add one. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mWavesSaid: @Jingiby. That would be anachronistic. Only the terminology has changed since Cepenkov's time. His language ''is'' Macedonian, but it once ''was'' described as "Bulgarian". Let me put this in perspective for you: what would your argument be had he called his language "Chinese"? rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mJingiby: His language ''was'' Bulgarian, but today it is classified as Macedonian, after such language was codified. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mWavesSaid: No, Macedonian only gained an additional variety after its standard was codified. According to the same logic, Bulgarian has only existed since 1899. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
