[31mGliderMaven: Corruption rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mGliderMaven: According to  the NPOV on Capitalism is that there is no corruption in capitalism, it isn't subject to it at all; it is no way a weakness of Capitalism. Rich individuals never pay off politicians to write laws to distort markets. We Wave Been Told. Corruption can only happen under communism or whatever(!?) Apparently he's going to edit war until that's widely accepted. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mThe Four Deuces: You are referring to the reversal of your section on corruption.  The problems with that section include that it is unsourced and does not explain the connection between corruption and capitalism.  Advanced capitalist countries actually have lower corruption levels. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mAbsolutelypuremilk: Firstly,  did not say that. Secondly do you have any reliable sources that say that corruption is more prevalent under capitalism than other economic systems? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mGliderMaven: I made no claim that is more common, only that it is a known weakness that rich individuals not infrequently pay/finance politicians for favourable laws. Are you claiming that corruption cannot happen under capitalism and that it shouldn't even be mentioned? There's articles like crony capitalism and robber barons about how that happens at least ''sometimes.'' You certainly get corruption under (for example) communism, but it's usually of a different form. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mAbsolutelypuremilk: I am not saying that it cannot happen, but that doesn't mean that it should be included. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mGliderMaven: Crony capitalism shouldn't be mentioned in an article on capitalism? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mAbsolutelypuremilk: The material that you added made no mention of capitalism, it was a general look at political corruption, not specific to one economic system. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mGliderMaven: OK, then I will add crony capitalism. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mThe Four Deuces: Crony capitalism is already mentioned in the article but if you want to expand it, you need to show its relevance.  As I understand it, underdeveloped and Communist countries have a history of corruption that continues as they develop capitalism.  So a neutral way to put it into the article is to explain the introduction of capitalism into these countries that do not have strong liberal traditions. rebuttal_labels::
