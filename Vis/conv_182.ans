[31m189.104.125.79: The Greatest? rebuttal_labels:: 
[31m189.104.125.79: Hello, I'd like to know why Maradona's article is the only for a footballer that states that he is the greatest footballer of all time. PelÃ©, Beckenbauer, Cruijff, Garrincha, none of theses player's articles says that. Thank you. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mKevin McE: The first response is that it doesn't say that.  It says that some people have described him as such, and then has a vast number of citations to prove that the statement is true.
The other reason is that each article attracts the attention of different editors, and different editors will choose to phrase and construct articles differently.  Don't expect formulaic consistency across Wikipedia. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34m201.50.41.96: So if someone wants to edit PelÃ©'s article the same way (and, believe me, a lot more people say he was the best, there are even more sources), noone will revert it? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34m201.50.41.96: And I don't expect "formulaic consistency", I expect impartiality. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mLsw10: Citations about polls, and votes of players and experts should not be deleted.
These references should not be deleted from the page. That is vandalism. http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/best-x-players-of-y.html#ff-pochttp://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/bestbest.htmlhttp://worldsoccer.about.com/od/players/tp/Greatest-Soccer-Players-Of-All-Time.htmhttp://www.marca.com/2012/03/09/futbol/equipos/barcelona/1331276984.htmlhttp://footballsgreatest.weebly.com/dream-teams.html#/news/http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2931/go-global/2010/10/22/2178640/over-50-per-cent-of-goalcom-uk-readers-believe-brazilianhttp://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamHons/HonsWldSocPlyrsCent.html
Considering the whole number of different sources the phrase: ''Many experts, football critics, former players, current players and football fans in general consider Maradona as one of the greatest football players of all time.'' is quite accurate.   â€”Preceding undated comment added rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mLsw10: Kevin McE, Wikipedia states: ''Editing from a neutral point of view (NPOV) means representing fairly, proportionately, and as far as possible without bias, all significant views that have been published by reliable sources.'' '''All significant views'''. That was what my references were about. Editors here only include the FIFA internet poll, the only major poll which Maradona won, and omit prestigious Ballon D'Or, IFFHS, and the most respected football magazines and experts, among them Guerin Sportivo, and World Soccer magazine. Votes from the 30 Ballon D'Or winners in 1999, from the International Federation of Football History and Statistics, and from internet polls from Marca(over 85000 voters) and Goal com '''are''' significant and should not be removed or omited.   â€”Preceding undated comment added rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mLsw10: Kevin McE,Your reasoning is not sensible at all. Many players have people regarding them as the best ever, that does not mean that their Wikipedia page justifies the description: Regarded by many as the best in history. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mKevin McE: Why did you post that precise claim at an article then? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mLsw10: The amount of sources supporting that claim in that article justify that description, which was actually not first written by me. I started by just adding further references. Many people have chenged the text content through the years of the article. You are the one who deletes references and leaves the Maradona article much more poorly sourced than I do. Any player can just have a couple of references stating he is the best of all time. It is still a bit misleading. I explained about the value of the Ballon D'Or, and the IFFHS votes. Omiting them indicates a biased point of view. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[36mLsw10: With this logic any player who receives a few votes in the Yearly FIFA Ballon D'Or vote, or in fans poll, can justify a comment in his Wikipedia page as something like this: ''...x player is considered by many as the current best player in the world.'' Players like Iniesta, Xavi, Neymar, Cristiano Ronaldo, Ibrahimovic, Falcao could all have that description and with justification, since there are quite a few who believe that they are the best in the world today. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mKevin McE: 16 refs is plenty. Your intentions here are clear, and unencyclopaedic. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mKevin McE: Re your ballon d'Or comments, such temporary comments are clearly inappropriate if undated, but are you suggesting that it would be inaccurate to say that many respected commentators considered any of those to be the best player of the early 2010s?  You would clearly be in error to oppose such a statement. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mLsw10: No, they just three references on the top of the page. Unless you regard as serious references in players like widely unknown scot FRANK McGARVEY and biased Argentines Mario Kempes, Lionel Messi and Maradona's son in law Sergio Aguero! Like I said earlier, then you are the one who should show consistency and edit many players pages who also have claims as the best in the world or the best ever. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[36mLsw10: Quoting another user, Cambalachero, deleting sources is VANDALISM. "It was mere vandalism, it was undone. Thanks for your contributions Cambalachero (talk) UTC". Look below at the "Vote" section. No, it would not be inappropriate if it was that specific as you describe now. Naming person. But not generalizing taking advantage of a few quotes. Do not delete references, it is considered vandalism. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
