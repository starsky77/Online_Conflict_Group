[31mPiotrus: Important fact rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mPiotrus: I don't understand why this well referenced fact is getting removed. Battle of Warsaw (1920) saved Lithuanian from Soviet occupation in 1920 (as clearly noted by several referenced historians) and hence is a crucial event that shaped interwar Lithuanian history. The fact surely deserves to be mentioned? | rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mIrpen: It is removed per WP:UNDUE. We've seen such adding the same info to multiple articles before, going by a wider and wider scope. This is unacceptable. The trick of pasting same info to several articles is not new ("Brest parade" or Russian Enlightenment (Zaluski library_ examples come to mind.)
There are narrow articles for narrow issues like that. This is the second largest by scope Lithuanian article. This is exactly what was done by now gone  who added a section ''Homophobia in Poland'' directly into Poland article even though LGBT rights in Poland was readily available. Piotrus was right to revert the fellow back then and I expect the same standards applied to Polish and Lithuanian topics. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mPiotrus: There is nothing wrong with pasting important fact into several relevant articles. This is a crucial fact that belongs here. The outcome of the Polish-Soviet War saved independent Lithuania - this is stated clearly by several historians who specialize in Lithuanian history (Lithuanian Senn, Polish ≈Åossowski, and others). This is not a fringe undue issue like the one discussed above (a good counterexample); it's a major event that seems quite 'in place' here.| rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mIrpen: Your view that "there is nothing wrong with pasting" illustrates the problem perfectly. You did not pioneer this approach and you and I even managed to agree when this was done years ago by Molobo and together removed such stuff. I am saddened to see that you now resort to same. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mIrpen: Just to be more specific, we are talking the width of the scope here: both of the article (extremely wide scope, second largest scope of all Lithuanian topics) and the piece of content (narrow claim related to a fringe (by the sacle of the topic) event, besides a POV, even if referenced, rather than an undisputed fact.) Same info pasted into several articles of the same scope/width ''may be'' acceptable. This is not the case. Just curious, is there a reason why you did not paste this also directly to the Lithuania article to its history section or even lead? If you answer this question, it would be easier for you to agree with me here. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mPiotrus: This is off topic, but there is nothing wrong with pasting information into many articles - whether it's a redirect / disambig fix, a relevant newly uploaded image, reference or expansion - as long as it is of due weight, as in this case.| rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mPiotrus: The main Lithuanian article barely has room for the mention of P-L war and the P-S is a bit off topic to it. This article, which has room to mention both and go into the situation in more detail, certainly can mention the not-so-fringe battle (listed by some in the top twenty or so most important in mankind's history) that allowed Lithuania the crucial two decades of independence between the world wars.| rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mZscout370: If the paragraph could be cut down just a tad, I think it can go in there. 1000 bytes of information, with appropriate citations (which this article lacks, btw), could be a bit much. Also use links when needed. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mM.K: I have to agree with Irpen here and per similar per WP:UNDUE concerns expressed per above dispute (which I will resume soon after will solve another one). Plus I would like to request a border citation of source ''Antanas Ruksa, Kovos del Lietuvos nepriklausomybes, t.3, p.417'', to pin point a context. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mNovickas: Pasting a predictably contentious paragraph across several articles - not in the spirit of consensus. As an example of a differing interpretation, from the Cambridge History of Russia: "Not least because of the Royal Navy offshore, the Baltic States - Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia - were where Lenin cut his losses. He granted diplomatic recognition to these bourgeois regimes..."  (the recognition was in July 1920 - the Battle of Warsaw was in August). The concept that Russia was planning to overrun a multitude of other states has been contested by Orlando Figes in ''A People's Tragedy''. I don't have any problem with the inclusion of a condensed version of this paragraph as long as it is balanced. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[33mDr. Dan: The unfortunate fact remains that ''"a spirit of consensus"'' and ''"balance"'' are not something that a multitude of edits from certain quarters consistently demonstrate. Your differing interpretations are refreshing and appreciated. rebuttal_labels:: 
[37mDoopdoop: I agree with Irpen here primarily due to WP:UNDUE concerns. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mPiotrus: What UNDUE? The importance of battle of Warsaw for Lithuanian independence is not a theory of one fringe historian but a fact repeated in many publications by many historians. I have mentioned Senna, ≈Åossowski, Ruksa. If that's not enough, have some more: Snyder Had the Poles been defeated in summer 1920, Bolshevik Russia would have certainly absorbed the tiny Lithuanian state."; Hiden: battle of Warsaw in August 1920, an event which brought considerably nearer the international recognition of the full independence of the Baltic countries; and others. I have no problems with shortening the para if editors think it is too long, but the event is certainly important (and no jokes about Royal Navy in the Baltic doing anything in 1920, please).| rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[37mDoopdoop: There were many events that weakened the Soviets and stopped them from taking over Lithuania and other European countries. While the miracle at Warsaw is one of the most important of such events, there are simply too many of them. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mPiotrus: Then can you name the others? With 4 or more citations from major publications for each? I find it dubious that the battle is to undue, when we have an entire unreferenced para on Bermontians; when we have a place to mention the unreferenced but "crucial help of Saxon volunteers" and when we have two paragraphs on how the Poles took control of the Vilnius region - with enough space to go into elections and League of Nations involvement - but we cannot find space to note that the Poles have nonetheless saved Lithuanian independence by thwarting Soviet westward aggression.| rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[37mDoopdoop: Why don't you write in the [History of Poland] article that the miracle at Warsaw has thwarted Soviet plans for taking over the whole Europe (or at least Baltic states, Poland, Germany, Hungary)? rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mM.K: I am pretty sure the relevant articles make appropriate claims; after all Battle of Warsaw (1920) has been a Featured Article for something like two years now. Notable historians such as A.J.P. Taylor, Norman Davies, Ronald Grigor Suny and others have noted as such (although often they refer to the outcome of the PSW in general, although this is a small detail - nobody can dispute that it was that battle which determined the end result of the war more than any other event of the war).| rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mM.K: This is just plain silly to compare battle of Warsaw and the Polish occupation of Vilnius in magnitude. Because battle of Warsaw is single bullet in the list. Moreover my plea for citations fo particular publications is not met till now. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[36mM.K: Indeed. A major battle in the world (European) history versus a minor border dispute that is major only to Lithuania (with all due respect) are not always comparable; however this article is centered on Lithuania and hence this makes the Vilnius dispute relatively prominent.| rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[37mDoopdoop: You have misunderstood my previous comment. Couple of minutes ago I have added abovementioned information to the History of Poland article, where it is much needed and was missing (maybe you would like to copyedit it a little bit). However in the context of Lithuanian history it should be noted that all anti-Soviet forces had a big role in stopping Soviets (there is even a book called "Churchill's Crusade: The British Invasion of Russia"), keep in mind that Soviets had to divide their resources to fight their many enemies. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mM.K: Prefect, I see the change in attitude towards Norman Davies, a notable historian, as he described here. Somehow, last time I was using him as reference, he was accused of using   flowery language. Any chance that we see at last his quote ''It was highly significant that Pilsudski could boast of not being a member of the Polish nation - which he once derided as "a nation of morons" - but a Lithuanian of Polish culture'' as cited in N. Davies; Heart of Europe: A Short History of Poland.p.139? rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[31mPiotrus: No strawmen or off-topic discussions, please.| rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[33mDr. Dan: Piotrus is correct. Pilsudski's calling the Polish nation morons is not relevant to the topic. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[36mM.K: It is a mere example, then in one instance it became "Important fact" in other "flowery language". Just trying to understand criteria, that is it. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[33mDr. Dan: I'm well aware that P.P. likes to use Norman Davies as a source when Davies supports a contention of his, and to dimiss him when it doesn't. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mTymek: I was very saddened to have read this remark by Dr Dan, who pretends to be a NPOV user, and yet he retreats to personal attacks on Piotrus. What does Pilsudski's remark have to do with history of Lithuania? Perhaps we should stick to the article, it will help in the future. It was just a friedndly remark, Dan, do not be grateful. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
