Indeed it is the essence of a synthesis towards original research. It is, of course, entirely possible that I am wrong and that this is an international term, but so far I've seen no source to support that assertion, and for myself I find it somewhat unlikely.

The very existence of The Australian and New Zealand Brats of Singapore which has been in existence since 2001 and had annual reunions since 2003 shows that this term is international.

It is also incontrovertable that at least two derviations (pad and scale-e brat) have no US antecedent.  Now if I were to argue that the terms scalee and pad brats were more common in the 1960s\'/70\'s, then yes that would be original research.  And yes, based on what I\'ve seen, I suspect that to be the case (people who use the terms appear to be older).

Perhaps this is due to British influence, since British military brats have been very mobile, especially were so during the time of the British Empire (up to the 1940s) and the Indian military was previously a part of the British empire.\nCanada, Britain, New Zealand and Australia also have degrees of mobility in the lifestyle. I don\'t know about the Philippines.
