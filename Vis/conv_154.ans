[31mJpatokal: Article name: protests, uprising or revolution? rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mJpatokal: As I type this, the article is named "Tunisian protests" (9481 hits on Google News), the lead calls it the "Tunisian uprising" (3954) and the box calls it the "Tunisian Revolution" (4123).  While I think the name is shifting in favor of "revolution", I'm going to reset them all back to "protests" until we agree on a better name and the article is rewritten accordingly. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mJpatokal: Also, the box claims the revolution ended on 14 Jan with Ben Ali's departure, but obviously the protests didn't  it seems a little early to call an end. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mJpatokal: One more interesting data point: even government sources now regularly refer to a "revolution" . If the government and the people both think it's a revolution, then I suppose it is? rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mUnused000705: I would still call it an uprising. Google might not be best on this one. Reliable sources, like the Guardian newspaper call it an uprising. Revolution might catch up and we can change it then. An uprising just means a more wideranging movement than protests, which this is. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mCs32en: In my view, an uprising is characterized by an actual or perceived threat of the application of coercive force on the part of the participants, while protests may be confined to the expression of opinions and demands.Â Â Â Â  rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mUnused000705: An uprising is "an act of resistance of rebellion", it could be non-violent a la Gandhi, so violence is not the main factor. Protests are less wideranging. What is occuring is the 'rising up' of Tunisian society (not just one group or social class) so I think uprising is appropriate for now. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mCs32en: An uprising may remain non-violent, but the aspect of potential violence is one of the characteristics of an uprising. As Gandhi said, "I do believe that, where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence... I would rather have India resort to arms in order to defend her honour than that she should, in a cowardly manner, become or remain a helpless witness to her own dishonor."Â Â Â Â  rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mUnused000705: It is hard to tell whether there will be violence or not. The whole crisis was not predicted by any serious commentator in the west, Tunisia was considered a model for the region in its stability. That said, uprising still seems to me to be the best description of events. Some have gone as far as to call it a revolution. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[36m72.228.177.92: A Revolution, if the people of North Africa can keep it. But not here, not yet. "Protests/Unrest" seen from here at this point. If a second government collapses, then a larger article worthy of the event will come pretty quickly with something like Revolution in the title. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mLihaas: I think, and discussed above, that a move to at least uprisin g is more than warranted. though id hold off on revolution just yet (unkless it was called a generic revolution with the "jasmine" caveat)(  ). rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[33mNightstallion: I think "Tunisian Revolution" or "2010â€“2011 Tunisian Revolution" or "Jasmine Revolution" are all sensible article names by now. â€” rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[35mLihaas: the sources for revolution (#3,4,5) link to youtube and facebook. which i think we can all agree is not RS. Jasmne revolution as discussed here was moved to the unbolded parts of the lead because of its limited nature in the media, whereas the universal media hasnt tagged it as such. And the gerneral bolding og the timeline is unwarranted by any precedent.(  ). rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
