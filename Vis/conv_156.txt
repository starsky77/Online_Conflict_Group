{'text': 'Thanks for explaining. Can you link me to the discussion that determined the inquisitor article should be excluded? I searched and didn\'t find consensus to not use that article (mostly about aceloewgold.com, whatever that is). And this is all I found searching WP:RSN about using it as an RS. And there are other sources that connect the Satanic ritual claim with the mention of "spirit cooking" in the leaked emails; see: Snopes. This isn\'t to claim that the spirit cooking is actually Satanic, but that that was why the connection was made. And if we\'re mentioning the theories, we should state the reason behind the theory. This is already done for the handkerchief code theory (explaining that it arose based on the email saying: "The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related."\nRe: FBI document: We can put "unverified" prior to "F.B.I. document" if you like. However, again, the point is not whether it\'s been authenticated or not, but the fact the theory of the logos being connected to pedophile logos arose based on the FBI document.
