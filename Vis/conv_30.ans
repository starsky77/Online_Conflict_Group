[31mD4R1U5: Final 11.1 Beta rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mD4R1U5: I know that’s edit warring, but some people don’t understand that betas are not official releases. Wait till it releases officially, like next week or something. Be patient. (By the way iOS 11 has 10 betas). rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mD4R1U5: YOU are pretty sure, but do you have a confirmation from Apple? WP:SPECULATION. That’s it. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mKamranMackey: No, but why does that matter? Apple has left the 3D touch app switcher ability in for 3 betas since 11.1 Beta 2. That's a pretty big sign that they AREN'T going to remove it. So I think I'm allowed to write that it was re-added in Beta 2. That's all there is to it. You can't keep reverting everybody's edits just because it doesn't flow well with you dude, that's called edit warring. Anyways, back to the question, I do think beta 5 is the final beta, and that's because I've been using the iOS betas for a while now, and I've studied how Apple releases their betas. It's usually a 4-5 beta cycle with minor updates (11.x, not 11.x.x) and a smaller beta cycle with smaller updates (11.x.x), and a larger cycle with major iOS updates. (Example being iOS 11 had 10 betas before it was released to the public, and iOS 10 had 8 or so) -   · rebuttal_labels:: DH7: Refuting the central point
[32mKamranMackey: Lots of people understand what beta means. Sure, some people don't, but a lot of people do. And why should I wait until next week to re-write something I already wrote? There's no reason why I should. I've edited Wikipedia a lot. I think that me writing that it was re-added in beta 2 is perfectly fine. And actually, since released by Apple, they are official releases, just not completely 100% stable, and on a different channel from "stable". They are still official releases however. -   · rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mD4R1U5: Betas are not official releases, they are meant for testing. Sometimes, Apple adds features in early betas, and then removed them in some later ones. You don’t have proof that beta 5 is the GM. And that’s why you are not allowed to add it until the final version. WP:SPECULATION. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mKamranMackey: When there is no letter at the end of a version number string in iOS beta versions (Example: Beta 3 had the version string 15B5086a, while Beta 5 has the version string 15B93), that's an indication that it's the GM. I've done my studying, so you're incorrect. -   · rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mD4R1U5: Wikipedia is not based on independent study or rumors. You need to source everything. For things like this, you need an official source (from Apple), not from any third-party site. You never know, Apple may suddenly release another beta. Why can’t you just wait for a few more days (less than a week), till the stable release comes out. WP:ORIGINAL applies. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mKamranMackey: What I said isn't based on independent study or rumors. It's based on facts. Beta 10 of iOS 11 was the Golden Master AND the final release, with the exception of the GM & final release having the "a" omitted from the Beta 10 version string (15A5372a/15A5372). I think I know what I'm talking about. Beta 5 of iOS 11.1 is the Golden Master. -   · rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mD4R1U5: If there ''are'' some last minute bugs that need fixing, Apple may release another beta. You '''can't''' be sure without an official source. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mKamranMackey: There's a calculator bug, but that's minor and Apple isn't going to release an updated GM for that tiny bug. -   · rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mD4R1U5: . Can you guys please provide your opinion on whether it is appropriate to keep this before the official release? rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mD4R1U5: Check this and this. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mGuy Harris: As the saying goes, it ain't over 'till it's over. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mGuy Harris: Maybe "Beta 10 of iOS 11 was the Golden Master AND the final release, with the exception of the GM & final release having the "a" omitted from the Beta 10 version string (15A5372a/15A5372)", but we need a ''citation'' on that, not a "I think I know what I'm talking about." claim.  Apple doesn't say anything obvious about that on developer.apple.com; if you have a citation, let's see it.  (And it's been a while since I retired from Apple 6 years ago, but, from my days as a Core OS software engineer, I don't remember offhand any case where they dropped the letter at the end of the build number, rather than bumping the build number; as I remember, that letter is for minor tweaks to a build that don't involve a complete build of all the projects, and going from 15A5372a to 15A5372 would mean that the GM was missing those tweaks.) rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mGuy Harris: So I'd personally wait for 11.1 to come out before we talk about what is, or isn't, in it, anywhere other than the 11.1 beta section of iOS version history. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
