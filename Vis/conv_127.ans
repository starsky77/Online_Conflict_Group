[31mRockypedia: Date of Death not confirmed rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mRockypedia: So far, there's only one place that lists the date of death as December 22 - the NY Daily News.  Two problems with this: the article says "died December 22 in Bethlehem, Pa., Stern announced in a statement on Tuesday." - when Stern did not, in fact, announce an exact date; there's no date on the Stern page that the NYDN article links to, either.  Second, that date may well have been pulled from this wikipedia page - it was added, unsourced, by an anon IP at 01:20, 6 January 2016 rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mRockypedia: Legacy.com appears to be just an aggregator that pulls dates of death from other news articles. It's not independent and likely pulled their info from the NY Daily News article, and the date in that article is suspect, as discussed above. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mRusted AutoParts: That's your own original research and just plain guesswork. Legacy is a site that takes in numerous obituaries and prides itself in providing accurate information. Is it not possible this IP that worries you added it upon seeing the Legacy or New York Daily News obit and simply didn't link the source? All that is at this point is assuming and guesswork. Unless you have any valid, sourced reasons to counter, I'm going to link the Legacy article to the page and correctly move Martin's back to the Deaths in December 2015 page. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mRockypedia: Legacy is a site that takes in numerous obituaries and prides itself in providing accurate information. - that sounds like your own original research and just plain guesswork. The anon IP that added the date to this page added it 21 hours before the Daily News article appeared, so no, it's not possible. The Legacy entry is not dated or time-stamped, but the first comments there appeared on Jan.6 as well, and since the Wikipedia edit was made on Jan. 5 (local US time), then no, that wasn't after seeing the Legacy entry either. The burden of proof is on you to provide proof that you know Dec. 22 was the date of death, not the other way around. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mRusted AutoParts: Nope, it's still on you. Your assuming that Legacy isn't reliable is YOUR own guesswork. We can keep slinging accusations of who's guessing on what, but burden of proof is on you to prove December 22 isn't correct. We can't go by "IP added it this time, followed by NYDN 21 hours later". That's assuming that paper read Wikipedia and saw the date. And thus you add onto the assumptions that Legacy read the Daily News after. So since we have a reliable source saying December 22, we can use that, with no strings of unreliability attached. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mRockypedia: You should check out Wikipedia:List_of_citogenesis_incidents. There's a good bit of evidence that that's exactly what happened here, because while many other news sources reported Martin's death, only one of them listed an actual date of death, and that reporting came long after the Wikipedia edit in question. I'm not saying he definitely didn't die on Dec. 22 - I'm saying that until it's confirmed, that should not be listed as the date of death. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH4: Repeated argument
[32mRusted AutoParts: ...But it has been confirmed. By Legacy. Seriously, what proof do you have that Legacy or New York Daily News cited Wikipedia as being the place they found the December 22 date? We can't prove that in the 21 hours between addition and publication that NYDN looked here and grabbed the date from there. If you can prove thst, fine. If you can't then Martin should be moved to December 22, as we have a source for that. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mRockypedia: I don't think you can ignore the strong evidence that this is a case of circular referencing just by saying "if you can prove that, fine". Those other cases Wikipedia:List_of_citogenesis_incidents serve as a reminder that we should be cautious about getting it right. If the December 22 date is so definitive, why didn't more media outlets publish it? TMZ is a pretty accurate source, and they didn't publish a date. Neither did any traditional news sources, such as USA Today. This NY Daily News article says "He passed away in early January", and that's the same source that you claim is so reliable. I'm just saying that in this case, when Wikipedia may be used as a source for a subject that received minimal coverage, we should be very careful about perpetuating incorrect information. That's my main concern. What is your main concern? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mRusted AutoParts: My concern is you assuming it's a case of Wikipedia sourcing itself. My concern is you labelling sources like Legacy, a site which it's main function is publishing obituaries, unreliable. I'm asking you to give me a reason to believe it's a case like previous ones, you keep basically stating " it's happened before". Those we were able to prove, here we have not, except the assumption that they took their information from us. If they put "per Wikipedia, he died December 22", Id be in agreement, but since no cite to Wikipedia was made, we can't confirm or deny. NYDN is gossipy, so it's why I don't value it as much as I do Legacy. I again implore you to provide evidence to prove your point for this exact circumstance, rather than bring up prior cases, cases that do not offer any evidence towards this one. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Repeated argument
[31mRockypedia: It's not an assumption; there's evidence to believe it may have happened, and in this particular case, I believe we should be cautious, as we run the risk of the circular reporting reinforcing itself, if that's what did happen. Legacy gets its info from newspapers, and the newspaper to originate that date of death was the NYDN. So if you don't trust the NYDN (I don't, especially given their other page that said Martin died in January) then you can't trust Legacy ''in this case''. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mRusted AutoParts: there's evidence to believe it '''may''' have happened - Rockypedia					False
2	2016-04-25 19:37:03	Rusted AutoParts	That's an assumption right there. So I ask again, please provide '''evidence''' that they read Wikipedia and got the date from there. 					False

1	2016-04-25 19:40:02	Rockypedia	Hang on now. Did you just switch from saying NYDN is gossipy, so it's why I don't value it" to "NYDN is my reliable source because I just realized Legacy got their info from them"? It's okay to admit you may have been slightly mistaken about Legacy.com, you know. No one is going to admonish you for that. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Repeated argument
[31mRockypedia: Also, if you're going to use NYDN as your reliable source, which article are you going to use? The one that says he died on Dec 22, or the one that says he died in "early january"? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mRusted AutoParts: Where's your evidence that I made that statement? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mRusted AutoParts: Where's your evidence Legacy took it's information from NYDN? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mRusted AutoParts: And finally, again, where's your evidence both those sites visited Wikipedia and got the date here? Answer a fucking question. Please. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH0: Name calling/hostility
[31mRockypedia: Please don't get abusive. Despite the profanity, I will answer your questions with information that I've already provided above. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mRockypedia: You said "please provide '''evidence''' that they read Wikipedia and got the date from there." - you didn't specify who "they" was, Legacy or NYDN. I took it to mean NYDN. Please be specific. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mRockypedia: Legacy takes its info from newspapers, as is evidenced in the link I provided. The only newspaper to publish a date of death was the NYDN. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mRockypedia: I'm not saying Legacy visited Wikipedia. I'm saying they got their info from NYDN. Their own website says they take info from newspapers, and NYDN is the only newspaper to publish a date of death. So please advise, are you now saying NYDN is a reliable source? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mRusted AutoParts: No, i'm not, and once again, you're assuming. So now you must provide evidence Legacy got their info from the NYDN. What if they weren't the only ones to publish a date? You can't skate by assuming everything. I'm feeling like you're just wasting my time now. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH-1: Bailing out, DH4: Repeated argument
