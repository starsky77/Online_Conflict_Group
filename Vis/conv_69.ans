[31mElvenscout742: Official UK title rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mElvenscout742: I have been reverted several times by two different users on this. I now need to provide my justification here for what should have been an uncontroversial edit.
The film is officially licensed for distribution in the UK and Ireland by Eureka. They released the film on DVD under the title ''Ugetsu Monogatari'' and then later re-released it on Blu-Ray under the same title. In this, they are following the usage of the BFI, the previous distributor of the film on VHS
The film does not appear to have been referred to as ''Ugetsu'' (without the second word) in official British or Irish sources since at least 1998. '''''PLEASE''''' do not remove this again: ''Ugetsu'' is the American title; ''Ugetsu Monogatari'' is the British title. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mJoshuSasori: It wasn't removed from the article, it was put under "release/home media". rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mElvenscout742: The statement that this is the official (and implicitly best-known) title in the UK and Ireland was removed, and the wording implied that the film was not known by this title before 2008, but it was available on VHS (from a different company) under the same title in 1998. Prominent variant titles belong in the intro for clarification purposes. As an Irishman I was not familiar with the American title of this Japanese film until I read it on Wikipedia. ''The Avengers'' (2012 film) gives the UK title in the '''''opening sentence''''', even though that film is American and is known throughout the world by its American title; this is a ''Japanese'' film that is known as ''Ugetsu'' in America, but as ''Ugetsu Monogatari'' in its country of origin and in several English-speaking countries. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mKauffner: This issue relates to the RM and is likely to be of far less interest to readers than it is to editors. It certainly doesn't belong in the lead. Also, the word "officially" doesn't convey any additional information; It is a WP:PEACOCK word. If ''Ugetsu Monogatari'' is the name used to refer to this film in Britain, that does not support the proposed title of Ugetsu (film). rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mElvenscout742: It only relates to the RM in so far as the current title of the article is ''not'' the title by which the film is known either officially or casually in the UK and Ireland. When have I ever said that the official title of the film in UK and Ireland supported the title being changed to Ugetsu (film)?? If I had ''my'' way, this article would be titled according to the way I first learned about the film, and not in this silly "abbreviate the Japanese title" that seems to be quite common in North America. (Admittedly, the latter film is known as ''Kuroneko'' in UK as well, that is why I have not mentioned any variant title on that article.) However, I understand that ''my'' way is unreasonable given that this film is known in some English-speaking countries as ''Ugetsu'' and the article has always had this title as a result. This is why my above RM relates exclusively to this film being disambiguated from the far more famous book of the same name, and does not attempt to move the article to its Japanese/British/Irish title. Your attempt, despite this, to read bad faith into my edits to the article has been noted. Why is it a peacock word to mention that the film's official release title in several English-speaking countries is the same as the Japanese one? Surely by calling the article by its "official" American title you are doing the same thing? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH5: Counterargument
[31mElvenscout742: Additionally, it might be pointed out that the Eureka page provides yet another literal/accurate translation of the Japanese title (as a gloss for the meaning of the title, not saying "this applies only to the film and not to the book", or acting as an "official UK title"): ''Tales of the Rain and the Moon''. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mRibbet32: Official implies it's official, as if decreed by law or something. I've left the British "alternate title" in the intro but changed the wording. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mElvenscout742: I didn't actually want to say "official" originally, I wanted to say "is sold as", but this seemed inappropriate. Additionally, the UK title is every bit as official as the American title, since the American title also was not thought up by the film-makers, but rather by an independent distributor. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mJoshuSasori: Elvenscout742 has already vandalized this page to make a point, by moving the page then changing the redirect to Tales of Moonlight and Rain without making the slightest effort to relink any of the then-mislinked pages. This addition of the UK title, his reverting of consensus, and endless nitpicking argumentativeness on the talk pages, is yet more of the same outrageous behaviour that he has exhibited elsewhere. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[36mRibbet32: Regarding this: - Elven, boy, am I getting tired of you.  But actually, if you're making a claim in an article, the burden is on '''you''' to provide the source.  I'm not going to revert again, but I'll ask someone else to, and ask that we can build a consensus on this. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mElvenscout742: Wow, I didn't think you would resort to name-calling this fast. Anyway, there is no need for me to cite three or more sources, or to build consensus. You are working against a clear Wikipedia guideline here, as outlined below.
By the way, I thought I could get this through peacefully with logical debate and reasoning, without having to rely on MOS, etc. My change has stood for a few hours and it looks like this might be over, but I should probably point out for posterity that WP:NCF is very clearly on my side here:
'Use the title more commonly recognized by English readers; normally this means the title under which it has been released in cinemas or on video in the English-speaking world. Normally, this will be an English language title that is recognized across the English-speaking world; however, sometimes different English-speaking countries use different titles, in which case use the most common title, and give the native and alternate English title(s) afterward.'' rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[36mRibbet32: What name calling?  Anyway, your quote below doesn't really help you. It says the title under which it is released is "normally" the most commonly recognized, but not always.  You have a source saying the movie's been released under a title in Britain, but not that that's the best-known title; it is pretty reasonable that the wording be altered to reflect this.  I can see why you have "no need" for consensus, though. So far consensus has not been your friend. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mJoshuSasori: I too do not understand what "name-calling" refers to. rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[31mElvenscout742: Sorry, my screen was dusty and I didn't notice the comma in your comment, so I read it as " Elven boy, am I getting tired of you". I have sources that say the film has been released three separate times under the title ''Ugetsu Monogatari'', and I have not seen any evidence that the film has ever been released under any other title in the UK in the last 50 years. It is ''obviously'' the most widely-known title, since it is the only title under which the film is commercially available. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
