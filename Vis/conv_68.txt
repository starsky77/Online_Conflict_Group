If I say that some ODE is simple someone can argue that is not, but for me is not too hard. For this calculation you have to see all the matches from now to the end, valuate the tiebreaker criteria, look when a team is qualify or not, so the math beyond it is "simple", is only sum, but all the working with that is not, in particularly the hth criteria. So it is WP:NOR, and there also the problem of WP:CRYSTAL: \'\'Articles that present original research in the form of extrapolation, speculation, and "future history" are inappropriate.\'\' And how you can tell that a section that start with \'\'On the \'\'\'next\'\'\' matchday\'\' is not a extrapolation, speculation, and "future history"?', 'username': 'Stigni', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}

The basic arithmetics is what can do my grandma with a calculator; not if you have to think about it and do all cases, this is NOT basic arithmetics!! And verificable means that exist a third part article that said this, so usually you can find ref for the LAST matchday scenario, and so it is ok, but if you cannot find a ref, any kind of it, it is not verificable; see also WP:GNG.
