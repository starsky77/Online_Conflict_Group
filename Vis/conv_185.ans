[31mFezmar9: Edit war over post-metal in infobox rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mFezmar9: The details contained within an infobox are meant to be more general than specific. Deftones' music has been noted to be influenced by a number of different genres over the years. Hell, the musical style section of this article lists a dozen or so different styles that Deftones have been referred to as. But the infobox should not contain all 12 of these genres. Which ones should it contain? Maybe two or three of the genres most commonly used to describe the band's sound overall. In my own research, the top two are typically nu metal or alternative metal. The sources provided in this article currently do not describe the band's overall sound to be post-metal. The ''Honolulu Weekly'' continuously being added by Trascendence does not describe Deftones' overall sound as post-metal, but merely says the band "dabbles" in various genres such as post-metal. In fact, I don't think any of the five sources in the style section say Deftones' overall sound can be described as post-metal. For these reasons, in addition to the reasons found in HrZ's edit summaries, I do not support the inclusion of post-metal into the infobox. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mNJZombie: I agree. Additionally, unless I'm mistaken, aren't sub-genres not to be included within infoboxes? It's not a policy I necessarily agree with myself, but I seem to remember that being the guideline. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mTrascendence: -In favor of post-metal
I don't understand why  now says that don't supports it, because he is a regular editor of the article and post-metal was added when he was around  (see May 22 onwards, his name appears three times after post-metal was added) he was aware of the addition and seemed to be ok with it.
The question here rather than why post-metal must be added would be why this source  is enough to add "experimental rock" to the infobox, but when comes to add post-metal, using the same source, then "it's not enough". Post-metal have more sources than experimental rock has, and unlike nu-metal there are no writers and reviewers saying that Deftones was lazily/accidentaly labeled as such (that without mentioning that Deftones haven't played anything close to it in more of 10 years), wich if doing a WP:UNDUE balance, would leave nu-metal out. If anything post-metal has more supporters than any of these two and there is no real reason to leave it out at all, this looks as if other editors had some personal opinion about the band not playing post-metal or not being post-metal enough, disregarding all the sources that backs up the genre, and also ignoring that wikipedia is not about personal opinions, but verifiable sources. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mFezmar9: Neither of  your bullet points seem at all relevant, nor are your opinions backed up by reliable sources. I have 1,200+ pages on my watchlist and I also have a job and attend school. I don't have the time to check every single edit on my watchlist. My interest in this article has mostly pertained to recent events in the band's history; I really don't care about edits made elsewhere and I only stepped in because I saw an edit war beginning. Experimental rock in the infobox is an entirely different argument. This discussion is specifically about post-metal's inclusion in the infobox. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mFezmar9: The following points of yours are purely opinion and not backed up by any evidence: "Post-metal have more sources than experimental rock has," "unlike nu-metal there are no writers and reviewers saying that Deftones was lazily/accidentaly labeled as such (that without mentioning that Deftones haven't played anything close to it in more of 10 years)" and "post-metal has more supporters than any of these two and there is no real reason to leave it out at all." rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mFezmar9: Now, let me illustrate this point with a table. The following illustrates various genres Deftones are sometimes labelled as, and the number of times an article in Google News' archives associates Deftones with a given genre. It should not be assumed that the number hits directly correlates to the number of articles that actually ''call'' the band this genre, as it's entirely possible that there's an article about another band that happens to mention Deftones. However, this simple Gnews test should give a pretty rough idea of what published and authoritative sources refer to the band's genre as. Notice how post-metal, and what you claim to be a synonym of post-metal, "metalgaze," have the fewest hits? It's easy to infer from this chart that Deftones playing post-metal is a minority opinion at best. This table also suggests that your earlier points of post-metal having more supporters than experimental is invalid.

[34mTrascendence: My points are relevant because i have the sources to back up my statements and i'm acting accord to Wikipedia's policies. How can experimental rock and post-metal be a different argument when both appears in the same source and wikipedia criteria must remain the same for all the content included in the sources? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mYawaraey: Actually, you searched "deftones" "nu metal" for everyone of them. If you search any of the other genres, nu metal and alternative metal were the only ones that showed up more then ten times. Post-metal showed up four times and "metalgaze", zero.
Also, experimental rock only showed up once, so, you should be more careful lest you want that removed. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mFezmar9: I cannot account for this discrepancy. Though each link clearly has nu metal in the URL, clicking on each link correctly brings me to the proper search results reflecting the same exact data I have providedâ€”this might be due to Google's new feature where it searches for results while you finish typing. Maybe part of the search is saved in my computer's memory, while the rest is in the URL? How did you perform your own searches? I had both the band's name and the genre in their own quotes in my search box (<"Deftones" "nu metal"> OR <"Deftones" "alt metal">), also performed a Gnews Archived search. Regular Google News only searches for results within the last few weeks, but a Google News Archive search digs up hits older than the last few weeks. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mYawaraey: I just replaced "nu metal" in your search results with tags such as "alt metal", "alternative metal", etcetera. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mFezmar9: Hm, I really don't know what to say. I just clicked on all those links using a different computer on a different network, and they worked just fine. Can someone else try clicking on the links and see if they experience the same issues as yawaraey? Alternatively, could someone pull up a Google News Archive Search (without clicking the links provided) and try to conduct the same searches? rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mHrZ: Links all work fine with me. Also, I'm not going to reiterate what I said in my edit summaries or what I have said to Trascendence on his talk page, but I do not support the inclusion of post-metal into the infobox. On another note, with this edit Trascendence removed more of the hidden note, without explanation. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mTrascendence: I removed that part of the hidden advise because it was the same message repeated another two times. Not sure how these links works for you, but when i click into nu metal there is only 17 results, anyway, to search words is not a legit way to validate your statements or in fact anything, use articles that clearly refer to the band as nu metal, stills, there is nothing that refutes Deftones being post-metal. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mHrZ: I'm sure there is a reason it has been repeated, perhaps so that no one could ignore it? Anyway I could be wrong but I'm sure this discussion is wither or not there is enough for it's inclusion in the infobox as a prominent genre along with the three already there, not wither or not their music is post-metal. The source you provided states that they dabble in numerous subgenres listing post-metal among them. Doesn't say outright that they are a post-metal band. The fact that there is a source is no reason either, because a number of genres (including nu metal and experimental rock) have sources in the musical style and influences section of the article (it should be noted that the sources provided for metalgaze and post-metal in that section were deemed unreliable in a previous discussion). As Fezmar9 said, it would be ridiculous to include all of these genres in the infobox. Why should post-metal be included instead of any other genre? If the arguement is simply "it has more sources" then it would help you're arguement if you could provide them, making sure they are reliable by Wikipedia's standards. The reasons for their being sources in the infobox in the first place is due to the genre warring that happened constantly over a year ago (see this discussion). It was due to this warring that the notes stating "Discuss any changes through the "discussion" tab before making them" were added to the article. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH5: Counterargument
[34mTrascendence: Down in the "musical style" section post-metal is the genre with more references, and from these, at least three does it fine regarding the reliable sources topic (so much that are used to back up another statements in this article). rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mHrZ: There are enough sources that it merits a mention in the article (which it already does) but having "more references" isn't a valid arguement seeing as how some should be removed or moved. The ''Honolulu Weeky'' merely states they have dabbled in post-metal. Straight.com states only shoegaze not post-metal. Sputnikmusic mentions post-rock, not post-metal (pretty sure I mentioned that in a previous discussion). And Thrash Hits isn't considered reliable. Creative Loathing does refer to ''White Pony'' as a "shoegaze-metal" but that leaves you with barely two sources. So why should it be included in the infobox above any other sourced sub-genre? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH5: Counterargument
[34mTrascendence: Because if we apply the same highly demanding criteria that you're applying to post-metal any of these other genres will barely have reliable support at all. Actually Thrash hits is now borderline , while is prefered to keep it away in controversial topics, this is not the case, because there is another five sources (Three of them reliable) claiming the same thing. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mHrZ: Borderline? Now you appear to be selective; "You might be correct, if you could prove he vets every article on the site, or that he wrote the article in question. Neither of those facts is true though. '''Ergo, not RS'''" is the last reply from the editor (as of this posting, there may be more replies by the time you read this). And where is the five sources? Not all the sources after post-metal in the musical section are sources for post-metal, one is just for shoegaze, one says post-rock (to quote an earlier reply from you: "'''use articles that clearly refer''' to the band as nu metal." Clearly this article doesn't say post-metal) and Thrash Hits is not unreliable per your own check at the reliable sources noticeboard. Honolulu Weekly has been used more than once, I hope you are not counting that as more than one source. So again, you only really have two, Honolulu Weekly and Creative Loathing. And what about what the sources state? One album (not the band's overall sound) is labelled as shoegaze-metal while another source states they have simply dabbled in post-metal. This doesn't give the impression of a prominent genre. But what is your arguement for it's inclusion in the infobox (when it's already included in the article)? All I could gather is that post-metal has some sources but no reason as to why it should be included in the infobox. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mTrascendence: As i said above if we were willing to apply the same highly demanding criteria that you're applying to post-metal any of these other genres will barely have reliable support at all. Post-metal would still among the most sourced genres, that's why, and it's a fact that Deftones music is refered as post-metal more often than experimental rock and is less debated than nu metal, if anything post metal have more weight than these two. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
