[31mMootros: There was no Germany before of 1871. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mRjensen: False. the RS (Reliable Sources) write about Germany before 1871. (Fuhrmann and Reuter, ''Germany in the High Middle Ages: c.1050-1200'' (1986); Arnold, ''Medieval Germany, 500-1300'' (1998); Reinhardt, ''Germany: 2000 Years'' (1961)) It's an issue of  names and some historians indeed use "Kingdom of Germany" re the medieval country. Look at John Gillingham, ''The Kingdom of Germany in the High Middle Ages (900â€“1200)'' Historical Association Pamphlets, General Series, no. 77. London: Historical Association, 1971. rebuttal_labels:: DH7: Refuting the central point
[31mMootros: Not a widely established view among historians. The original Latin name does not say Germany either. Misses the point of the article because it does not really refer to such a construct called "Germany". There is nothing wrong to mention that some historians use this name, but it's not enough to name the article after this. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mMootros: This article is not about a concept by a minority of English speaking historians, but about an area ruled by several members of different dynasties that was referred to as rex teutonicorum, or king of the Germans. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mRjensen: Mootros lacks RS in English for his plan to change the usual title to "Regnum teutonicum". Amazon.com lists only one book containing the title "Regnum teutonicum" and it's in German.  Amazon list only ONE English language book that uses the words "Regnum teutonicum" somewhere in the text -[''The Medieval Empire in Central Europe'' by Herbert Schutzhe also uses the term "German kingdom"]. The point is that Latin term is VERY rarely used in English. In common scholarly usage we have thousands of cites to '''"German Kingdom"''' (as in ''Henry IV of Germany 1056-1106'' by by I. S. Robinson 2003)and indeed in many British books going back to Freeman and Bryce a century+ ago...and today by leading writers such as Imanuel Geiss (1997), Pierre RichÃ© - 1993, The Oxford history of medieval Europe (1993), Eric Goldberg - 2006, Andreas Dorpalen - 1985, Kurt Aland - 1986, Angus MacKay, David Ditchburn - 1997 etc etc.  So perhaps as a compromise we can suggest "German Kingdom" as a title. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mMootros: The suggestion by Rjensen makes much more sense! '''German Kingdoms''' possibly. The current title is utterly confusing and bias towards a minority of who retrofit previous events and concepts into current way of thinking. Before the Enlightenment a king ruled over people and not over a land. Hence the very name "King of the Germans". People in Europe generally thought of themselves as custodians of the land that belonged to god. Hence definitely not (king of) Germany. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mPmanderson: This contemporary account of Crecy uses ''rex Franciae'' and ''rex Boemiae''. The Kingdom of ''England'' is much older, attested of Henry I. Kings of peoples did of course exist in the Dark Ages; but Philip VI of France is not the beneficiary of the Enlightenment - by about four centuries. rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[31mMootros: ...by Thomas Wright 1859 referring to text of unknown author. How does this relate to a world view in the place that came to be known as Germany. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mPmanderson: Wright is an editor; and John of Bridlington may be obscure, but he is not unknown. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mMacX85: Well, late medieval source speak of a kingdom "Germania" and a title of the emperor from Maximilian I. was "rex Germaniae" which literally means "king of Germania" or Germany. So why can't you speak of a "kingdom of Germany" if contemporaries can? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
