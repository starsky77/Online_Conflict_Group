[31mMarcel Baron: Suppression of reference rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mIÃ±aki LL: I am the main contributor to this article and, coming down to detail, there is nothing that leads us to think that the invasion of Hispania was a premeditated plan. Information available suggests that developments on the ground escalated from an initial military support by Tariq to the officialist faction led by Achila II on into a full-blown political takeover of the Visigothic Kingdom. This is suggested by Roger Collins. ''Collins, Roger (1989). The Arab Conquest of Spain 710-797''. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mSwazzo: your edit summery 'Rv fully sourced info...' is strange since I only added further referenced content and did not remove the sourced info added by Marcel. Is there a specific reason for your removal of the sourced content I added? Regards - rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mIÃ±aki LL: Um...I took a look at this, where no mention is done to the Caliph. Also the source that would support your claim does not say anything about any Caliphs. Plus from what I can remember, Collins does not support a Caliph sending orders to invade Hispania. Regards rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mSwazzo: I also took a look at the source added by Marcel and it does not say anything about any Caliphs. It instead refers to his ''wali''. Don't get me wrong, Collins is well-respected historian, but I think it's fair to include differing information from other reliable sources. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mIÃ±aki LL: The thing is none of the sources cite a Caliph, so why add it? A wali is cited, but I think it refers to the next commander breaking into the Peninsula, al-Nusayr. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mMarcel Baron: Hello, you do not even try to check the source I posted, you immediately deleted my sources. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mMarcel Baron: Several Arab-Muslim historians mention that Tariq would have decided by himself (which would cause the anger of his superiors) to land in Spain, and this must be taken into account
See here: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariq_ibn_Ziyad
the French wikipedia article is completely sourced. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument

[34mSwazzo: What about Was a Time When... the Moors Ruled Spain, p.17? or Past and Present, Chapter 7. The Islamic World, 800-1300, Tariq ibn Ziyad? rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[36mKansas Bear: 'There was a time when the Moors Ruled Spain'', is self published(AuthorHouse), and the author has written a similarly titled book about the Romans. Do you have information concerning this author?
Your link goes to this:
'Civilizations Past and Present, Single Volume Edition'', By CTI Reviews,
and not what you wrote, ''Civilizations Past and Present, Chapter 7. The Islamic World, 800-1300''
Civilizations Past and Present, Single Volume Edition to be a testing book, can not find a publisher and I see no author. Doubtful RS.
For:
'Civilizations Past and Present, Chapter 7. The Islamic World, 800-1300''
There is no match on google books. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mSwazzo: Yes, it's ''Civilizations Past and Present, Single Volume Edition''. I was referring to the location of the info since the ebook does not provide any page numbers. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[36mKansas Bear: Care to explain                   this edit?
'Under the orders of Caliph Al-Walid I...''
Referenced using, ''Moorish Spain'', Richard Fletcher, page 1. Where exactly does it state Caliph Al-Walid I ordered the invasion on page 1? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mSwazzo: A slip on my part, I thought that a "Berber army under Arab leadership" would suffice. Can we cite ''Civilizations Past and Present, Single Volume Edition''? rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mKansas Bear: Swazzo, ''Civilizations Past and Present, Single Volume Edition'', does not appear to be a reliable source. Also, please quit using {{od}} for your responses. Use  to indent your responses. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mIÃ±aki LL: The source says nothing of the Caliph, so do not alter the statement, that is WP:SYNTH or (as bad) misrepresentation of sources. Thanks rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mIÃ±aki LL: I do not know what the point is of adding the Caliph, it does not look like precise or safe information, it is speculative altogether. Not having further time right now, and would need to confirm it in detail, but Collins, who elaborates on the matter, does not find any evidence to support such claim. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mIÃ±aki LL: This is getting a bit boring, Swazzo. Please do not alter the content of sources, that is WP:SYNTH at best (please read it), if not WP:OR and misrepresentation of sources. You may add that phrase in another place if relevant. Thanks rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mSwazzo: please tell me, what do you find faulty in the sentence: rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mSwazzo: The sentence does not mention or imply that the Umayyad conquest was a premeditated plan in any way, shape, or form, it simply states that it took place during the reign of Al Walid I. Also, a source has to actually support its adjacent claim and far more than 'Forces led by Tariq ibn Ziyad' is cited and quoted. I moved the source to a relevant section where the event is discussed in detail. Regards - rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mIÃ±aki LL: I am trying to be didactic but you are not hearing, right? rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[36mKansas Bear: Is there some unknown reason why Swazzo is removing the source, ''The Muslim Conquest and Settlement of North Africa and Spain''? And continuing to edit war to remove it? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
