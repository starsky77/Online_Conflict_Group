[31mNovidmarana: There are many studies out there that try to measure the number of uninsured, with widly varying conclusions. Defining underinsured is inherently subjective and thus all estimates will vary with the concrete defintion of uninsured that is employed by the study. A Meta-analysis of studies is "How Much Health Insurance Is Enough? Revisiting the Concept of Underinsurance", Medical Care Research and Review, Vol. 63, No. 6, 663-700 (2006), DOI: 10.1177/1077558706293634. They find that estimates of the percentag of uninsured range between 2.9% and 53%, all depending on the definition and the methodology of the study (thus also making it hard to compare all the numbers from all the different studies). Citing only one study, especially one yielding an estimate that is in the higher range of estimates, is rather unbalanced and POV. See also WP:RS, quote:
Studies relating to complex and abstruse fields, such as medicine, are less definitive. Avoid undue weight when using single studies in such fields. Meta-analyses, textbooks, and scholarly review articles are preferred to provide proper context, where available. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument

[32mDocKino: It's time to call an end to your tendentious campaign against addressing this issue. The current statement is not backed by "random newspaper clippings", as your disingenuous edit summary claims. It is supported by two articles from the country's leading daily newspaper, describing three major studies whose findings have been released in the last four-and-a-half months. There is no reasonable basis for your POV tag, and it has been eliminated. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH6: Refutation
[31mNovidmarana: Excuse me? I pointed you to a meta-study, which according to WP:RS is preferable to random newspaper clippings. And this meta-study show that your cherry-picked studies are not representative, like it or not. And the sentence "Millions of insured Americans also have difficulty meeting medical costs." is not very informative anyway, because it does not say anything about how many Americans are affected (2 million? 200 million?), and even worse difficulty meeting medical costs is something completely subjective.
And tendentious campaign? Really, maybe I could say the same about you and you repeated insertion of POV material that contradicts academic meta-studies. Please address these concerns before removing the POV tag, or remove the sentence in question. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Repeated argument
[31mNovidmarana: And for further reading, quote from WP:RS: "For information about academic topics, such as physics or ancient history, scholarly sources are preferred over news stories. Newspapers tend to misrepresent results, leaving out crucial details and reporting discoveries out of context. For example, news reports often fail to adequately report methodology, errors, risks, and costs associated with a new scientific result or medical treatment." rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mMrzaius: On a tangentially related note, noone owns this article - Please try to keep that in mind before issuing such dismissive comments as the first comment by DocKino above when attempting to explain a revert of an obviously good-faith edit (which, by the way, there's been rather a lot of going 'round lately). Let's keep it civil, especially when we're dealing with other established editors. That said, the tag did seem a little off the mark - It's not so much POV as it is a bad source that should be stricken, along with its data, with an explanation here when contested. Note that noone has raised any objection to the proposed edit Novidmarana, to point - Seems reasonable to me. The only thing I'd say is that the practice here of linking to popular press sources when available gives much more layman-accessible sources. If the study above has garnered any press, it'd be nice to have one well-written article ref'd as well.   ''Btw, my apologies if the above seems a touch more curt than need be - I initially read this conversation out of context, without seeing the more reasonable one above it.'' rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[36mDCGeist: (A) The single "meta-study" Novidmarana keeps pushing is over two years old. References to three independent studies that have reached similar conclusions within the past six months is obviously preferable.
(B) There is nothing in Novidmarana's favored source that contradicts the statement that now appears in the article. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mDCGeist: As a side note, Novidmarana has reasonably inquired if there are any studies surveying this issue in other developed nations. There are. The Commonwealth Fund conducts periodical multinational studies. The 2005 study surveyed six wealthy nations (US, UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Germany). The three questions on access to health care vs. cost show that the United States is the clear "leader" in cost/access problems. See here.â€” rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mNovidmarana: A) Silly statement. Not only are you completely ignoring WP:RS, you do not even seem to understand what a [[meta-study}} is. It is not me who favors this source, but WP:RS. If you would have read at the least the introduction to this meta-study you would understand that the definition of underinsured drives the result leading to estimates that range from almost zero to more than fifty percent. That these studies are newer has only one effect, that is having newer data available. The fundamental problem of defining underinsured stays. It is really time to ask to stop pushing your NYTimes newspaper clippings, and accept that we have a guideline WP:RS that clearly states that meta-studies are preferable to single studies, scholarly studies are preferable to newspaper clippings. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Repeated argument
[31mNovidmarana: B) As I said already above, the statement "Millions of insured Americans also have difficulty meeting medical costs" is completely uninformative as it does not tell us anything about what millions of Americans means (2 million or 200 million), and does not tell us anything what difficulty meeting medical costs means (if I have to sell my Rolls-Royce to be able to pay my medical bills is that a difficulty already?). Per WP:WEASEL we should avoid sentences such as this, especially as this sentence merely hides that there is no generally agreed number of underinsured in the US, not even close. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH5: Counterargument
[31mNovidmarana: Hence remove, and please argue here with Wikipedia policies and guidelines instead of your personal opinion on what we should include here and what not. And lastly, as a side note: Maybe the three questions on access to health care show that the United States has the highest percentage of complainers, but there are other questions (preventive care, prescription drugs etc) where the answers are not that clear-cut. In any case, this is a questionnaire, not a study. There is a difference, because a study attempts to correct for things such as selection bias and so on. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[35mArnoutf: No need to be aggressive, I think DCGeist was pretty reasonable. Also note that DCGeist notices that a metastudy which is more than two years old out of necessity does not contain newer sources. I think this is a good point, newer (reliable) arguments provide growing insights and are therefore more relevant. A meta study only gives the view of the investigated period (A meta-study from about AD 1450 would provide the argument the world is flat). rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH4: Stating your stance
[35mArnoutf: I agree millions is a problematic statement; however even 1 million uninsured would be noticable. It is beyond doubt, as shown for example by DCGeist's reference, that underinsuring is a problem in the US compared to other developed countries. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mNovidmarana: Well, I explained that all above. The fundamental problem of all these studies is defining the term underinsured. Depending on the definition a study employs you can get anything from zero to hundred percent of all insured being underinsured. That is why the meta-study shows that estimates range from 2.9 to 53 percent. The new studies add nothing to this basic problem of defining the term underinsured. They use new data, but they do not tell us how these percentage estimates would vary with using different definitions of underinsured.
Also WP:RS is clear about the use of meta-studies VS single studies and academic studies VS newspaper clippings. Two years is not very old, things change, but nothing suggests that the numbers have changed dramatically so to make a difference.
Furthermore, there is alot of doubt that underinsuring is a problem in the US compared to other developed countries, because this is not what DCGeist reference addresses. The reference is an opinion survey, not a study that addresses problems such as making numbers comparable across countries or addressing a possible selection bias. So far no study has been forthcoming that applies the same definition of underinsured across countries and makes an international comparison.
The sentence "Even for insured Americans it is frequently difficult to meet medical costs" gives no real information and is completely subjective. They same could be said about almost every country as no definition is given what difficult to meet medical costs means. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mNovidmarana: Lastly, if we are at it. If we point out all those insured that have difficulty meeting their medical costs, for the sake of neutrality we should also point out all those uninsured that would have no difficulty purchasing health insurance, see Is health insurance affordable for the uninsured? respectively should also mention that a large number of those uninsured are illegal immigrants, see Immigration's Impact on The Size and Growth of The Population Lacking Health Insurance, something that is too often forgotten in international comparisons, because these ignore that illegal immigrants are not insured in most developed countries either. rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[33mBlueSalo: A few comments. Apparently the problem here is that there is no good and water-proof definition of what underinsured means, resulting in wildly varying estimates of the number of uninsured. That means that we should not try to hide that there is considerable disagreement on this. Choosing studies as a reference that give estimates at the higher end strikes me as very unbalanced, apart from that WP:Reliable Sources is very clear about what sources are preferred.
I am not sure whether the current statement ''for insured Americans it is frequently difficult to meet medical costs'' is a compromise or not, the problem is, as is pointed out above, that this sentence is ambiguous (because it attempts to encompass all those estimates of the number of uninsured) and thus gives no real information to the reader. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mDCGeist: Well, like many compromises, it gives less definitive information then many of us might wish, but it still succeeds in indicating the important pointâ€”that not only noninsurance but underinsurance is a significant problem in the United States, one thatâ€”as we knowâ€”affects not only the daily lives of many Americans but political contests and public policy priorities as well.
On another point, Novidmarana's observation about the connection between the large number of uninsured and the large number of illegal immigrants in the United States is well worth considering. Unfortunately, the study he references dates from 2000 and is based on health coverage data from 1998. If we can find a more recent reference, we should look at recasting the relevant passage.â€” rebuttal_labels:: 
[33mBlueSalo: But then we could also write just the opposite, that is ''for insured Americans it is frequently NOT difficult to meet medical costs''. It would imply exactly the opposite, but with estimates of the number of underinsured between 2.9% and 53% (according to what was said above) this would be covered by the sources as well. If the problem of underinsurance needs to be included because of its political implications, well, then we should write that out in full, something like ''underinsurance is an important topic in the political discourse'', with good source, obviously. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mDCGeist: For insured Americans it is frequently NOT difficult to meet medical costs? Really? We should articulate an obvious assumption like that? No. The current statement is worth including because it indicates something that is ''not'' immediately obvious. Many readers are likely to assume that possessing insurance essentially ensures (yes) that medical costs will not pose a significant problem. Our multiple, up-to-date sources indicate otherwise. The statement and the links that accompany it advance understanding. Articulating the obvious would not.â€” rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[33mBlueSalo: That is why we have WP:NPOV - the sources support both version of the statement as whether the right statement is "insured American frequently have" or "frequently have NOT difficulties" depends on what estimate one uses and depends on how one interprets the numbers (there is no clear threshold above which one says frequently and below one does not say frequently - is it 50%, 25% or 10%, who knows, that is very subjective.). So one has to choice which statement to use. I agree that one would not include "frequently have NOT difficulties", but logically that does not imply that one should use the other version, as this would be POV. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[33mBlueSalo: It is not even clear whether our source indicate otherwise (ie all sources, not only those that made it into the newspaper this year), because with this wide range of estimates they do imply anything except that we do not know much and that there is no scholarly consensus on the definition of underinsured. In the end that is the big news, and the article would gain if we would try not to hide this uncertainty. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mNovidmarana: Could not agree more, but I guess it is useless to repeat oneself again and again. No answer so far why we should ignore the WP:RS and prefer newspaper clippings to an academic, peer-review meta-study that establishes that there is no consensus on the significance of the problem of underinsurance. Using two studies (both not even published in a peer-review process), that give numbers at the very high end of the range of estimates is blatantly violating WP:UNDUE. The only argument forthcoming is that the meta-study is two years old (guess what, WP:RS says: The scholarly acceptance of a source can be verified by confirming that the source has entered mainstream academic discourse - the meta-study has, these two studies by advocacy groups have not). I said it above again and again, the fundamental problem of these studies is that there is no generally agreed definition of underinsurance. The new studies can add new data and could thus indicate trends. They do not establish a consensus on the definition of underinsurance, and have thus nothing to say what the scholarly consensus on the absolute number of underinsured is.
No answer so far also why we should use have a sentence that obscurs the truth that there is no scholarly consensus on the definition and the significance of underinsurance. We could phrase the sentence both ways, given the sources. Giving preference to just one version violates WP:NPOV. It was said that one version is obvious and the other is not, but that what is obvious and what is not is entirely subjective. For someone who is underinsured the current version would be obvious, to someone else the other one would be. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mDocKino: No, what's really useless is for you to step in and think you can simply delete well-discussed, well-sourced, and broadly supported article content because you don't like it. It's useless for you to falsely claim there are only two recent studies when you know there are three. It's useless for you to frame this as a debate over what the absolute number of uninsured is when the article clearly does not address that point. It's useless for you to argue that the passage in question should be dismissed as "entirely subjective," when it summarizes in plain English the common findings of three independent studies. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Repeated argument, DH0: Name calling/hostility
[31mNovidmarana: You are completely unwilling to address the points I raised, substituting debate with false claims of well-discussed, well-sourced, and broadly supported. My apologies if there are three and not two studies out, but as the article clear two studies were financed by the Commonwealth fund and one by the Kaiser foundation, so in fact it seems to be that we are talking about two studies and not three here (and we are still ignoring the scholarly consensus, yay why bother with scholarly consensus if we have sources that support our personal POV). Please explain why we should only consider these three (or two?) non-peer-reviewed studies by advocacy groups (what's next American Enterprise Institute as source?), and ignore all studies that have gone through the peer-review process. Maybe because if we would do that, we could not summarize in plain the common findings anymore, because there are NO common findings. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Repeated argument
[32mDocKino: Well, it's quite clear that there are three distinct studiesone was ''undertaken'' by the Commonwealth Fund, another was undertaken by the Center for Studying Health System Change with financing from the Commonwealth Fund. And a major correction to your claims: the Commonwealth fund study was published in ''Health Affairs'', a "''peer-reviewed journal'' that explores health policy issues of current concern" [emphasis added]. At any rate, all three studies are respectable enough to be reported on in the business pages of the ''New York Times''. Now, you've stated that these reports have been "cherry-picked." Let's see about that. We currently reference two major mainstream news reports describing the findings of three studies from two or three groups, depending on your count, and released in the past four-and-a-half months. Can you point us to any studies that have been released and reported on in the past, say, twelve months that reach contradictory conclusions? If you can, you may actually have a case. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[37mCanada Jack: Nope, it did went to the peer-reviewed process. Health Affairs seems to be peer-reviews, but the study was not published in Health Affairs as it is a Web exclusive. Furthermore, I have repeatedly pointed out that there is a meta-study that represent academic consensus, and following WP:RS we have to use this study, something you conveniently ignore by setting the bar at past 12 months. Two years is hardly outdated, especially as the basic problem of finding an appropriate definition of who is underinsured and who is not is the same as it was last year or the year before or ten years ago. Again, your choice of twelve months is cherry-picking, we are not talking about a meta-study that is ten or twenty or more years old, then you would have a case. And by the way, in medicine I would never trust a study that is four-and-half months old, has not been cited, has not gone through a peer-review process, has been released shortly before election day and has been released by two advocacy groups. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[37mCanada Jack: And if we are at it, using uncivil edit summaries and defaming me as tendentious editor do not add at all to the discussion. I raised several points that have not been answered - in particular, that is why we should ignore the WP:RS guideline on which sources to use, and which not. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[37mCanada Jack: Before everyone explodes here, why not phrase this in a manner such as  "Some studies suggest that  even for some insured Americans, it is frequently difficult to meet medical costs, though to what extent is difficult to quantify and open to differing interpretations." Something like that. That is if there is an agreement that this is truly a controversial issue. My two (Canadian) cents. rebuttal_labels:: 
[37mCanada Jack: Sounds better, maybe we could add something like: "Although the number of underinsured Americans is not known, with academic studies yielding estimates from a low 2.9 to a high 53%, the subject of underinsurance frequently features in political debates." Sources (a meta-study, and one or two newspaper articles on this subject establishing that it is a notable subject in the political debate. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mDCGeist: Let's just try to keep it more concise, while connecting it logically to the preceding passage thus: "The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americansâ€”estimates of which vary widelyâ€”is a major political issue." Anyone object to that? The topical articles, Health care reform in the United States and Health insurance in the United States (to which we should add links), are the place to go into more detail.â€” rebuttal_labels:: 
[33mBlueSalo: I agree, although I also think that the estimates of the number of uninsured are not varying that wildly, after all whether someone has insurance or not is relatively straightforward to measure (as opposed to underinsurance). rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mDCGeist: Oh, I think in context it will be clear that the phrase "estimates of which vary widely" applies solely to the underinsured, as this sentence would immediately follow the passage giving hard numbers on the uninsured, thus: "In 2005, 46.6 million Americans, 15.9% of the population, were uninsured, 5.4 million more than in 2001. The main cause of this decline is the drop in the number of Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance. The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americansâ€”estimates of which vary widelyâ€”is a major political issue."â€” rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mNovidmarana: I agree with all version mentioned - something that reflect that there is no scholarly consensus on the number of uninsured, but that nevertheless it is an important part of the political debate on the US health care system. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mDCGeist: Okay, I've made the change. Two references seem sufficient for the citation: I've added the 2006 meta-study supplied by Novidmarana and retained one of the news reports supplied by DocKinoâ€”the one that references the Commonwealth Fund study which, though it was published as a "Web Exclusive", in fact appear to have gone through the same ''Health Affairs'' peer-review process applied to journal submissions that appear in print. All the best, Dan.â€” rebuttal_labels::
