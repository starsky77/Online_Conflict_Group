Personally I think that no man wants to look like her, whether they are "white" or otherwise, so at the very least she could only represent an idealised version of a woman. Then there\'s the question of her obviously non-natural hair, and the fact that most so called "white" people are not blonde anyway. I don\'t think there is or can ever be such a thing as an "idealised white person", at best all we can achieve is some sort of idea of the vast diversity that exists within any given group of people, and even  then we are going to omit much of the variation.', 'username': 'Wobble', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'Alun, with all due respect, you are asking the wrong question.  The question is not "why" is Marilyn Monroe the most iconic example etc.  The question is "According to whom?"  When it comes to the article, if there is research on why people have different iconic representations of white people, we can discuss that research.  But when it comes to inclusion in the gallery I think the key issues are NPOV and V.  I am sure we all agree that there is no iconic representaton of ideal Whiteness that is shared by all people.  As with most things there are multiple points of view.  It may be a good idea to include images to represent each notable view of what a "white person" is.  I do not think Usergreatpower has to explain to us why anyone consideres MM the most iconic.

I\'d have thought that at least Knox, Beddoe and Milner were considered white by all standards. So I don\'t think it\'s at all accurate say that there are "no examples of people who are considered universally to be White". I suggest you atek a look at some of the physical anthropological works of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In these there are certainly many instances of East Africans and Indians being considered "white". Actually not that long ago there were about four different images of maps of "racial" classifications that showed just that. When one dispences with skin colour as a determining factor, as craniometry did, then we get completely different so called "races".', 'username': 'Wobble', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}
