[31mDr. Vicodine: Original research rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mDr. Vicodine: Next match day scenarios are not referenced and are a violation of WP:NOR. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32m87.212.203.152: Disagree. It's purely mathematical, it does not require references, as anyone can calculate and correct it themselves. E.g. 2+2=4 is not a statement that's original research or would require references either. They're fun, harmless and remove themselves over time, anyway. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34m68.44.73.17: Yes, Heaven forbid the site have useful information. rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[36mStigni: I agree with you if you said that is math, but it is not simple math. I study math at University, and if some one ask me what is simple math what I have to answer? If I say that some ODE is simple someone can argue that is not, but for me is not too hard. For this calculation you have to see all the matches from now to the end, valuate the tiebreaker criteria, look when a team is qualify or not, so the math beyond it is "simple", is only sum, but all the working with that is not, in particularly the hth criteria. So it is WP:NOR, and there also the problem of WP:CRYSTAL: ''Articles that present original research in the form of extrapolation, speculation, and "future history" are inappropriate.'' And how you can tell that a section that start with ''On the '''next''' matchday'' is not a extrapolation, speculation, and "future history"? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mStigni: Being a useful information is not quite for Wikipedia standard. If is not a verificable data it will not be put on any article. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mMotsjo: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:OR#Routine_calculations
What about this? I really don't see why the next matchday sections have to be removed now. They've been there for as long as I can remember, and technically they are just basic additions. They also provide an easy way to look up the various scenarios for all the groups and teams. I say we have a vote on this. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[33mSchnapper: Disagree too. I love Wikipedia's football related articles for their clear and good loking information and particularly for the next matchday scenarios. I spent a lot oftime to make the scenarios which were unashamedly deleteted today. Where is the respect? Those are scenario calculations based on official sources (the tie-breakig rules) so everything is verifiable. Show some respect to the authors!! rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32m87.212.203.152: It's quite easily verifiable. As said, it's basic math. It's just that the additions aren't referenced from an outside source. To me that seems taking policy way too literal and applying it for the sake of application. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[36mStigni: I agree with you, but see this. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[37mSven Manguard: I have reverted the change back. You cannot simply ignore long held practices because you don't like them. Get consensus first if you're going to do something like that. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[37mSven Manguard: And Dr. Vicodine, this is inappropriate. While it's good that you finally seem to have realized that the policy on edit warring does in fact apply to you, replacing one battleground behavior with another one isn't going to spare you any grief from the rest of the people that have to deal with you, indeed it will only make you look more intractable and reduce people's willingness to tolerate your presence on the project. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH0: Name calling/hostility
[36mStigni: I posted it on Football project and no one answer it as I said on my first comment here, so don't tell me that i have to reach a consensus when no one answer to my post on WP:FOOTY. It is not the first time that is said that is against the WP:NOR, indeed on all the league is always deleted, why this practice is accepted with CL and not on the Leagues' pages? The basic arithmetics is what can do my grandma with a calculator; not if you have to think about it and do all cases, this is NOT basic arithmetics!! And verificable means that exist a third part article that said this, so usually you can find ref for the LAST matchday scenario, and so it is ok, but if you cannot find a ref, any kind of it, it is not verificable; see also WP:GNG. I am a mathematician so I also like the next matchday scenario but Wikipedia is not the place for that. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mMotsjo: This is borderline ridiculous. If the simple math that is adding three, one, or zero points to a tally is considered original research, then there would have to be a lot of other practices discontinued. You couldn't pronounce a soccer team as the winner of a league, for example, before every game had been played. Yet this is done on every league page on Wikipedia, using the very same rules that are being discussed here. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mStigni: Yes but it has ref or anyway you can find a ref without any problem... Can you find ref that say exactly what you try to put on this article? It is simple math say that Man Uni is first to his group, with 12 pts and the second at 4 pts with two match to be played, and there is also a lot of ref (e.g.    and so on). rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
