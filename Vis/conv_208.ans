[31mRJFF: Emperor of Lan Na? rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mRJFF: Hello  Do you have an opinion or idea regarding this issue? It seems illogical or at least counter-intuitive that Lan Na is supposed to have had a higher ranking ruler title than Ayutthaya at a time when the former was just a vassal state of the latter. I guess that it is supposed to refer to the claim of being ''chakravartin''. But 1) is "Emperor" an inaccurate translation of ''chakravartin'' and 2) did ''chakravartin'' express a ''universal'' claim to power, not a title linked to a certain realm, so "chakravartin ''of Lan Na''" would be self-contradictory. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mRJFF: I have just found the same anomaly in the articles on Bayinnaung and Nanda Bayin. Perhaps  might have a say in this discussion, too? Why are they supposed to be just "king" of Burma, but "emperor" of Lan Na, Lan Xang and Siam, while Burma was indeed more powerful than Lan Na, Lan Xang and Siam at that time, and Lan Na's, Lan Xang's and Siam's rulers during independence are not referred to as "emperors"? In English-language literature I could not find a single reference for an "Emperor of Lan Na". And I could only find mentions of an "Emperor of Siam" and "Lan Xang" in anachronistic or non-expert texts, and they are referring to rulers of an independent Siam or Lan Xang, not foreign rulers who exerted the overlordship over these realms. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mIudexvivorum: In modern usage, ''chakravartin'' is often used to refer to a ruler of an empire, as emperor of Japan, emperor of Russia, etc. I guess that's why some people used the term 'emperor' in the articles where the religious/historical ''chakravartin'' is mentioned. But the concepts of the modern and the religious/historical ''chakravartin'' are completely different. So, I don't think the term 'emperor' belongs here.
Anyway, I'm not sure if Naresuan had ever used such a title as ''chakravartin'' in relation to his control over Lan Na. Nothing about the title ''chakravartin'' is mentioned in Thai documents, including all the existing royal chronicles, as well as Prince Damrong's commentary on them (ISBN 9744171448) and biography of Naresuan (ISBN 9743238735). In '‡∏ï‡∏≥‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏û‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ä‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏°‡πà' (lit 'Folk History of Chiang Mai'), a historical document of Lan Na, Naresuan is referred to with the titles '‡∏û‡∏ç‡∏≤' and '‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞' (ISBN 9748150623, page 97).
The book '‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏®‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏ï‡∏£‡πå‡∏•‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏ô‡∏≤' ('History of Lan Na') by Professor ‡∏™‡∏£‡∏±‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏î‡∏µ ‡∏≠‡πã‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏™‡∏Å‡∏∏‡∏• (ISBN 9786161800260) may be of use. Unfortunately, I've just donated it to my univ's library, which will be closed until Tuesday due to public holiday. So, I'am unable to consult this book for the nonce.
Maybe 'overlord' is a proper term (at least better than 'emperor). This term is used in Lan Na#Burmese rule. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mHybernator: Hi , I can only speak for the Burmese usage. Chronicles call Bayinnaung, among his *many* other titles, ''Min Ekarit'' (Lord Emperor) of his vassal states. ''Ekarit'' ("emperor") comes from Pali ''ekaraj'', not ''chakravartin'' (''sekkyawaday'' in Burmese.) Bayinnaung was ''ekarit'' of ''naing-ngans'' ("emperor" of "conquered states"). Neither he nor Nanda was ever called "king of Lan Na/Chiang Mai". That title, ''Zinme Bayin'' ("King of Chiang Mai"), in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, belonged to Nawrahta Minsaw. (In general, rulers of major vassal states were referred to with the title ''bayin'' ("king"). Exceptions were rulers of Mogaung, Keng Tung and Manipur, who though called ''sawbwa'' ("chief") by the chronicles were nonetheless allowed to keep their full royal regalia.)
I don't know how Naresuan's status as the overlord of Lan Na was referred to in Thai chronicles. AFAIK, ''Chiang Mai'' and ''Nan'' chronicles don't even acknowledge that Lan Na was ever a vassal of Siam during Naresuan's reign. I believe, we'd have to look at the ''Ayutthaya'' chronicle for the usage. Our Thai editors perhaps have access to it or other sources.
Anyway, as for the usage of king vis a vis emperor, I think we have a precedent in monarchs of the Great Britain (referred to as king and queen) being referred to as the Emperor/Empress of India. Two cents. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mRJFF: Hello  Thanks for your well-informed answer. Do modern English-language sources indeed render the native title of ''Ekarit'' as "emperor"? Sorry for my scepticism, but I find it always problematic to translate foreign royal titles into a different language, because these titles are usually tied to a certain social and political system and do not have a simple equivalent. Translating royal titles was very common in earlier centuries, but I have the impression that modern historians tend to avoid this practice more and more. A neutral term like "overlord" as proposed by  (in a statement that he/she has unfortunately deleted) might be more appropriate. In fact, I had thought of the England/India example, too, once I had saved my above question. But I think there is an essential difference: India, despite being under British suzerainty, was much bigger and more populous than the British mainland. This is not the case with the Burmese vassals, that were either smaller (e.g. Lan Na), or at most, roughly equal (e.g. Ayutthaya). So I think it is still unprecedented to link a higher-ranking title to a less powerful and smaller, less populous dominion. By the way, you have written that Bayinnaung is referred to as ''Min Ekarit'' "of his vassal states"; does that mean ''Min Ekarit'' of his vassal states ''in total'' or ''Min Ekarat'' of each of his vassal states individually, i.e. ''Min Ekarit'' of Lan Na, ''Min Ekarit'' of Lan Xang, ''Min Ekarit'' of Ayutthaya etc. I would assume the former. I do not have that much a problem with labelling Bayinnaung an "emperor" per se (in the sense of ruler of an "empire" that consists of the Burmese mainland and all of its vassal states), but I am very doubtful about labelling him "Emperor of Lan Na", "Emperor of Siam", "Emperor of Lan Xang" as if each of these were individual, separable titles (which I doubt). rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mHybernator: Hi , thanks for the thoughtful comments. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mHybernator: In Burmese, ''ekarit'' means emperor. For more academic definitions of the term ''ekarit'' (ekaraj) in English, see:  and
The chronicles do give his multitude of titles and names of his vassal states (including those that were more likely allies or protectorates in present-day India). But if you're asking if they specifically state in the form of: ''Ekarit'' of , no. (At least I haven't seen it.) Chroniclers, I don't believe, were thinking of in such neat academic terms.
I'm not sure if there are commonly accepted criteria as to what constitutes an empire. Relatively small territories (Vietnam, Korea, Haiti) called themselves empires and their rulers emperors. Of course, even the Toungoo Empire at its height in the grand scheme of things was rather small in comparison to other large empires.
FWIW, Lan Na was considered the most important, strategic vassal state by Bayinnaung and the Pegu court. The rank of the ruler of Lan Na was ''Bayin'' ("king") as was the case with Ayutthaya.
Now, many Burmese kings had grandiose titles that equate to emperor even if their domain was no more than a small region. They called themselves ''Min Ekarit'', ''Sekkyawaday'', ''Maha Dhamma-Yaza'', ''Maha Dhamma-Yaza-Dipadi'', ''Razadarit'' (''Yazadarit''/Yaza-di-Yaza). For example, Binnya Nwe controlled just the Pegu province at his accession but nonetheless proclaimed himself as Razadarit (king of kings; Raja-dhi-Raja). Of course, several Siamese kings also had the title ''Rachathirat''.
Overlord, to me, is a term of relative rank/position. The closest equivalent term in Burmese would be ''min'' which means lord but could refer to various office holders (governors, viceroys, or kings) or members of the royalty. A ''min'' could have vassals underneath him/her, and still have higher ranked overlords (''mins''). In the case of Burmese monarchs, they saw themselves as the top ranked ruler. (I'm sure Siamese monarchs thought the same.) So, to me, overlord doesn't fully convey the sense of the paramount ruler: king of kings. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mRJFF: I will not try to argue with you about the translation of Burmese terms (of which you have obviously a lot of knowledge, and I have none). However, the works you have just linked to, do ''not'' translate ''ekaraj''/''Min Ekarit'' as "emperor", but "sole ruler, universal monarch" or "Ruler and First Lord". As long as there are no references for the titles of "Emperor of Lan Na", "Emperor of Siam", "Emperor of Lan Xang" (being separate titles), I think it will be best to omit them from the infobox, per WP:Verifiability and WP:NOR. Some positions or relationships are too complicated to be summarised in infoboxes. Of course, the article's bodies will still mention these rulers exerting the overlordship over the respective lands. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mHybernator: Well, don't take my word for it. You can ask other Burmese editors as well. Here are a few other books that translate ''ekaraja'' as sole sovereign (emperor) or universal emperor: , ;  Anyway, that's all I have to say about the topic. I don't have a strong opinion about omitting them in the infobox here. Regards, rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
