[31mQwyrxian: Regarding a recent edit summary rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mQwyrxian: I just wanted to clear up a point of misunderstanding evidenced in your recent edit summary.  You said, "Added additional sentence for balance, to avoid misleading impression. Please don't delete without Talk discussion".  Actually, that's the opposite of how normal WP editing works. It's fine to boldly add new information to an article. But if another editor reverts, the onus is on the person who ''added'' the info to the article to go to the talk page and justify its inclusionnot on the one who wants to remove. The way I always think of it is that we're "conservative", in the sense that the default is always less and older information, with those seeking changes being the ones who have to justify their new additions/changes.
As a side note, we definitely cannot include that information from VINEthey are not an important enough group to have their opinion represented. Perhaps if Greenpeace, PETA,  or a similarly notable organization made a comment, perhaps we could include itbut not the comments of a random, non-notable activist group. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mQwyrxian: Actually, here's a better, more general point: stop editing the article, and keep discussing on the talk page. If you're having a discussion on something on the talk page, stop reverting on the article. The whole point is to ''stop'' edit warring, which you are very much doing on the article (as are some other editors). Another way of saying that is that just because you're talking on the talk page doesn't give you justification for continuing to force your preferences to the article. There is absolutely no hurry on the articlewe'll fix it over time. But we cannot functionally do that if people don't stop reverting and talk '''instead'''. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mPE2011: Thanks for explaining the process. Regarding VINE, they are at the heart of the controversy‚ÄîVINE was mentioned earlier in the graf. Why are they not important to be included? rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mPE2011: Qwyrxian, your characterization that the VINE is a ‚Äúrandom, non-notable activist group‚Äù is wholly inaccurate: as I mentionedand as it‚Äôs been documented in numerous sources, including the NYTVINE is a big part of this controversy. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mKingsrow1975: VINE is important because they made the first offer. That's it. They are quoted in news articles because of that fact. In reality, the most important entities involved in this whole deal are the college and the animal right activists. Since the initial offer, VINE has done nothing but make a few blog posts and "open letters" to the college. That is hardly being a "big part" of the issue. Read any story about this saga...by a large margin, the main players are the college and protesters. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
