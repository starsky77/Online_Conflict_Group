Unlike countries like Spain, this is an example of a country - and major player, member of the P5 - whose viewpoint we can pin down as consistent.

{'text': 'Kahastok this is \'\'\'an encyclopedia\'\'\'. What we do is write articles with relevant and properly sourced information. If a vast number of countries choose to be more vocal about their support for the Argentinian position, it is not our position to apply some "standard" and obscure mentions of this support just because other countries are not doing the same for the UK claim.\nAs this source clearly states  the EU remains neutral about the Falklands/Malvinas issue and the fact that the islands are included in the Lisbon treaty is "\'\'merely descriptive\'\'" and even more "\'\'This does not imply acknowledgement of UK sovereignty over the Falklands/Malvinas by EU members. This must be defined bilaterally between the UK and Argentina\'\'".\nSeeing that the Lisbon treaty \'\'\'does not\'\'\' imply support for the UK position, the mention of France as stated in the article is currently 100% wrong. The edit proposed here is much more accurate and I\'ve yet to see a reason by Kahastok as to why it shouldn\'t be added. I\'ll await some reason or else simply make the edit.

{'text': 'Could you please justify the reason for that tag, as on p.166 of Gustafson, Gustafson states that "France has been particularly vocal in its support for Britain", I\'m paraphrasing rather than quoting directly.  And could you explain why we need "renewed evidence", since we have reliable sources stating that France has supported the UK and as you advocate that we\'re not allowed to question reliable sources by our own original research.  Speculating that French support of a close ally has changed is of course your original research and demanding we prove a negative is of course impossible.  Equally, you appear to apply a double standard in that countries that have been equivocal in supporting any one country you appear to insist we state as unconditionally supporting Argentina based on one source, whilst ignoring others which indicate the oppposite.

{'text': "As has been pointed out Britain doesn't demand a statement in support every week, so why would there be regular and continuous statements of support?  It doesn't matter that a book is dated 1988,  its been regularly reprinted and the author has seen no need to revise it.  You are conducting original research through speculation that things ''might'' have changed and demanding a different burden of proof should apply.  The statement should reflect the source, that is all, we should not be interpreting it as you wish to do.  If we go back to a previous example, I questioned the use of Lopez as a cite, noting that Lopez claimed Goebel supported his hypothesis.  I simply pointed out that Goebel did not and questioned your insistence on the use of Lopez, at which point you were adamant I could not use WP:COMMON but had to knowingly repeat a false claim verbatim.  On that occasion you were absolutely adamant I couldn't question a source but here again you're using your own speculation as sufficient reason.  I'm struggling to see the logic, consistency of approach or the justification for the tag you applied, since the source verifies the statement and you've given no sustainable reason for adding it.
