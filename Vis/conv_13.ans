[34mTomica: Excuse me? I assume bad faith? You are the one acting like his stalker going around his "comments" on other user pages how they shouldn't have closed/opened etc. discussions and supporting him.

[32mGloss: I'm not sure where you're from, but in the U.S. calling someone a "stalker" is a very serious accusation, and not a word you should be throwing around so lightly. You've now used it twice. Lucky for you, I have very few feelings and a little punk who has his panties in a bunch because his article might be merged won't bother me anytime soon. But I'd suggest you refrain from using that kind of word around anyone else before you come across somebody who will put in the effort to have you blocked for it. Back to the point, this is a discussion about merging two articles, not about how much you don't like the person who proposed the merge. WP:ANI is that way if you think the nominator is out for "revenge". '''''' rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH0: Name calling/hostility, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mTomica: I meant a Wikipedia stalker, not a person/child/woman stalker. Wherever you from it's easy to understand the context [duh!]. As per the other part of the comment, I can express my opinion wherever I want, and I still think WP:REVENGE applies here. ‚Äî rebuttal_labels:: DH0: Name calling/hostility, DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[36mPetergriffin9901: ''Merge''' per both above. Honestly Tomica, it sounds like you're incredibly attached to this article and it comes off very biased.

[35mHƒê: ''Merge''' ‚Äì There are ''very'' few music videos that can be considered notable and have their standout articles (such as "Gangnam Style" and "We Found Love" ‚Äì both of which have achieved numerous awards and gained a huge number of views on video-sharing websites). Compared to the aforementioned articles, I personally don't think that the video for "Sugar" can have its stand-alone article. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[33mCalvin999: To be fair though, those two videos have been out for several years, so thy are bound to have more views on VEVO than a few weeks old video. ¬†‚Äî¬† rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[37mArre 9: ''Oppose''' per Calvin999's comments. The music video is notable enough to warrant its own article, and everything in the article itself is noteworthy. The video is sort of unconventional compared to the norm, and it is what seems to have propelled the song's performance. ‚Äî rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mWikimandia: ''Merge''' - this article is ridiculously long, particularly the introduction! I thought at first this was the entire article! LOL. Unless a video is somehow historical or notable in some way, I don't see how it's justified for it to be a separate article. Especially where you could watch the video five times in the time it takes to read the article. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mTomica: Longevity is actually '''why''' this article '''exists'''. A video doesn't need to be historic to have its own article. It has been a month since this video has been released, it had so many social media attractions (memes, controversies etc etc), 100+ million views on YouTube and will of course have a multiple video awards. And for your last sentence... watching the video =/= reading about how it was made. ‚Äî rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mTomica: ''Oppose / Keep''' it as a separate article. It has enough material to stand at all. Also WP:REVENGE has it steps here, having the fact the history if the nominator and his stalker has given to numerous of articles I created/edited. ‚Äî rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[33mCalvin999: ''Keep / Oppose''' - To be honest, there is a lot of valuable information here. Too much for the song article and would make it far too big. I wouldn't mind seeing this stay. Remember, this is an encyclopedia, guys. Promote information, don't reduce it. This article has had more than 10,500 views in the past 30 days, so I think we can safely say that it is notable enough to stay as a lot of people are looking at it. ¬†‚Äî¬† rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[33mCalvin999: It's not actually ridiculously long, but it's too long for the song article. ¬†‚Äî¬† rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mWikimandia: IMO it is ridiculously long. It's obsessively long. I hear your reasons Tomica but I don't see how it deserves its own article. Lots of videos are cool and popular and have guest stars and themes and get lots of views, but it doesn't mean they can't be described in a nice section of the song article. Check out Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.) - article about song and video living merrily together. This one too Dark Horse (Katy Perry song) and it had controversy as well. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mTomica: 'It's ridiculously long'' is nowhere a reason for an article to get ''merged''. ''If'' we merge this amount of words (about how the conception started, it was planned, shot, what the video is about, how the critics accepted it, controversy etc etc) will still be in the song article [according to you still long]. And for the upper mentioned examples, I do not need to go over videos which were notable and create separate articles for them if I do not want to (I am not a fan of Perry). If there is an interested editor he can try creating one and I will not oppose for sure. Tbh, I never planned to create a video article for this one either, but I found this great interview by the director and said why not, created an article that can perfectly stay on Wikipedia.‚Äî rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mMagiciandude: ''Keep''' per Tomica. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mStatus: ''Oppose'''. The music video itself meets WP:GNG. There is nothing in WP:NMUSIC that sets limitations on whether or not a music video can have its own separate article, and what are the qualifications that warrant it. ‚Äî¬†¬† ¬∑ rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mWikimandia: The length isn't my reason for it not deserving its own article. I was simply commentating on my initial shock at seeing the article. This is not Michael Jackson's Thriller. The point in referencing the other examples (and I thought of Katy Perry bc Dark Horse was the most watched video of 2014, and I think won best video overall at VMA) is that there is no need for them to have their own articles. If someone created them, people would promptly propose they be merged back into the song article. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mTomica: 'It's not notable like Thriller by MJ''... Does that mean only Thriller can get a video article? Because it was parodied/influenced a lot of other music videos? Shit no. That doesn't mean the "Sugar" video will not be notable one day. As I said ofc it will received a lot VMA/EMA/Grammy nominations and then what? We can create an article? Btw, Best Video was "Wrecking Ball" by Miley Cyrus, not "Dark Horse". ‚Äî rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mChasewc91: There are site-wide guidelines, however, on creating multiple articles about the same subject. WP:SPINOFF was cited in the AfD, but it says that "a section of the article is made into its own article" only when "an article gets long". The song article is ''not'' long, nor would it be with a condensed version of the music video article merged into it. ‚Äì''''''''''  / rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mChasewc91: And that's where ''condensing'' comes into play. No one is suggesting this forked article be merged back in its entirety. In fact, the music video section of the song article, as of this writing, looks perfectly fine as is, with no need for an additional article. ‚Äì''''''''''  / rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mTomica: If you think that's enough, I don't think. At the end of a day this is a merge discussion (getting the content from the video article to the song article) not deleting. We are not POV-ing the opinion of a single user on Wikipedia, when here are other users who think this article '''should''' exist on itself. ‚Äî rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mChasewc91: Four other editors besides myself disagree with a separate article existing, so I'm not sure why you're trying to suggest I'm the only one who thinks that. POV refers to article content, not discussions regarding content; obviously POV is at hand on both sides and that's the point. Don't misinterpret policies. Extra details can be added from the current video article, but I don't think there's much else that needs to be merged. ‚Äì''''''''''  / rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH5: Counterargument
[34mTomica: And yet that's your opinion. Four other editors agree with me. If this article gets merged most of the details apart of the lead [ofc] and the aftermath can go, the rest will be replaced in the Music video section. At least you should respect other users work which was done by using a reliable sources that can perfectly stay in the article. ‚Äî rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Stating your stance
