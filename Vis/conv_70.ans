[31mQazwsxedcplokmijnuhb: therapies "discredited" by quackwatch are actually promoted by mainstream health organizations rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mQazwsxedcplokmijnuhb: For example, Kaiser permanente offers qigong classes and approves insurance coverage for specific uses of acupuncture. Surely that's information enough to understand that a significant portion of the tripe contained in quackwatch should be taken with about a pound of salt.  (PDT) rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mAlexbrn: Quackwatch is RS for fringe/altmed topics, and has been found to be so many times at WP:RS/N. You can get homeopathy on the NHS; doesn't mean it's not garbage!  || rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mQazwsxedcplokmijnuhb: I honestly don't understand what's it to you. I am trying to make this page as encyclopeadic as possible, using available sources. This is obviously not a mainstream therapy, so not that many reputable sources are available, but neither is it quackery, despite what some angry MD somewhere might think.  (PDT) rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mAlexbrn: The article didn't describe it as quackery. We must use reliable sources and not pro-Rosen publications that give inaccurate non-neutral information.  || rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mQazwsxedcplokmijnuhb: None of the references (references, not external links) I cited are explicitly pro-Rosen. If you insist on the quackwatch references, others I posted recently must stay as well.  (PDT) rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mAlexbrn: Sources must be ''independent'' of anything Rosen as set out in WP:FRINGE; any biomedical claims (such as you have added) need to be backed by WP:MEDRS-compliant sources.  || rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mSimonm223: Also Quackwatch is frequently used as a WP:RS for alternative medicine articles - remember that it isn't the job of Wikipedia to present truth - just reliable information. And Quackwatch ''is'' reliable as a source of critique of alternative practice. To exclude it in an article like this invites WP:NPOV issues. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mQazwsxedcplokmijnuhb: I made absolutely no biomedical claims. I have cited articles in peer-reviewed journals that document therapeutic benefits. They are independent of anything Rosen. I have left your Quackwatch references in. I don't understand why you reverted my changes YET AGAIN.  â€”Â Preceding unsigned comment added by   â€¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mSimonm223: The Somatics journal also does not appear to be a WP:RS - rather it seems like a WP:FRINGE publication. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
