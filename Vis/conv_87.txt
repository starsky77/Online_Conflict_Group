{'text': "Thank you for protecting. I really didn't want to get involved in this dispute, but I kept seeing numerous reverts come up while I was on recent changes patrol and initiated a discussion with Xebat. Frankly, I'd say I tend to agree with the anti-Xebat crowd, yet I nonetheless find it inappropriate to repeatedly delete his dispute tags. I really wish everyone would just follow WP:1RR in these cases: Xebat tags the article, the tag is deleted, the tag is restoredleave the tag in place. He honestly has not been given adequate time to explain his complaint, and none of the editors here have shown him any respect or civility. He, on the other hand, was equally uncivil by adding a ridiculous number of inappropriate tags to the article with the intent of undermining its ethical appeal and making a point. As there clearly is a dispute about the factuality and neutrality of the article, I urge the editors here, after the article is unprotected, to leave Xebot's tag in place until a resolution is reachedeither through an overwhelming consensus, his concession, or mediation. It is most definitely inappropriate to repeatedly remove these tags only a couple of hours after they were originally posted. Leave them in place for at least a few days, and if everyone agrees that Xebot has made no valid statement of a dispute, then you can delete them without being rash and cruel.", 'username': 'AmiDaniel', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
{'text': "I think  deserves more credit than he's been given. Some users here try to push for certain terms and ideas to appear in the article not by concensus or cooperation but by carrying out constant revert wars and repeatedly taking off the dispute tags. This has got to stop. The article is on Iranian peoples but the source justifying its definition here comes from an article on Kurds. No sources have been provided that give a consistent definition of who Iranian peoples are and this is of great concern. Instead of looking for comprehensive sources and presenting them here, they have decided to just define things the way they see it and then look for (incomplete) sources justifying one sentence but at the same time contradicting another.", 'username': 'Aucaman', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
