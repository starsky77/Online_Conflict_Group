[31mArthur Rubin: The United States section consists of (IMO, excessive) quotes, without adequate context to verify that they are relating to what ''we'' call "plutocracy".  Furthermore, they are form a minority, if not WP:FRINGE, opinion, and should be balanced by reliable opinions which deny the claim that the US forms a plutocracy.  â€” rebuttal_labels::

[34mPincrete: If I can chip in here - for various reasons - since, ''(as the article itself points out)'' Plutocracy is inherently a perjorative term, and inherently has a strong element of value judgement about it, either including or omitting ANY country in a list seems fairly unproductive. What does seem productive is to put forward the character of the arguments that informed/articulate/reliable sources have made. I largely sympathise with Arthur Rubin and agree that the references to the US are excessive and fairly rambling. There are many pages where similar discussions COULD take place, but crucially, for example a page on democracy should inform as to the history of the idea and practice of democracy, should use examples of the success or failure of systems of democracy etc. .... It SHOULDN"T get itself bogged down in whether this or that place was or was not a democracy, which does seem to be what is happening here. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mEllenCT: What precisely about the sources and charts describing the US do you find "excessive and fairly rambling"? What is your assessment of their accuracy and agreement with the peer reviewed literature reviews? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[35mCollect: The sources, for one thing, do ''not'' call the US government a "plutocracy" and I regret that you are backing edits made by an edit warring IP at this point.   Aside from the sources '''not backing the claims made''', the new Princeton study has not been widely cited  nor accepted by others - in any contentious matters, a study which is cited by others is a better source.  Cheers. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mPincrete: ''EllenCT''', I presume your questions above were directed at me, since you quote me. Firstly I don't anywhere in what I said question the reliability of the sources, at least one source is published by Cam Univ Press, and ''(as far as I know)'' is completely academically legit. ... other sources I know nothing about, however I DIDN"T QUESTION the sources. To answer your other question, how am I expected to 'identify precisely' what is 'fairly rambling', isn't that a bit of a contradiction in terms? rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mPincrete: My main point above is that this is meant to be an article about Plutocracy, not an article about whether the US ''(or the UK or anywhere else)'' is or is not a plutocracy. In my own personal opinion ''(as a Brit)'', I am astonished by the extent to which the whole American political process ''(from 3500+ miles away)'', seems governed by money, campaign money, TV advertising etc., so I am fairly sympathetic to the accusation that disproportionate power lies in the hands of the very wealthy /big corporations /media giants. However, I wonder whether the innocent reader coming to this page wanting clues as to what plutocracy was as a concept, would want detailed charts on economic inequality in the US or income levels of US Senators. Perhaps this material does belong SOMEWHERE, and should be linked to here, but I wonder how useful/enlightening, beyond the general assertion that the US has been accused of/is sometimes seen as plutocratic is on THIS page. If you went to a page on Democracy would you really expect half of the page to be devoted to arguments about whether the UK monarchy, should or should not be called a democracy, or whether China was meaningfully a democracy? I don't think so, beyond recording that such discussions exist and pointing you towards those discussions. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mPincrete: My other point is that the word is inherently perjorative, and to a very large extent subjective, therefore no two people are ever going to agree as to whether this place or that place is plutocratic any more than they are going to agree about what is or is not ugly! rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument

[36mEllenCT: Do you think that the sources for the charts are sufficiently cited? rebuttal_labels::

[33m2605:A000:F2C0:A400:404:D21C:890A:A7EB: Is there a better page on which to discuss the modern plutocratic leanings of the United States?  I think this is a real issue that effects many people worldwide that ought to be discussed.  As an American I am deeply sickened that we spend so much tax money on overthrowing governments in other countries, bailing out corporations that deserve to fail, inefficient biofuels from corn, more wars to fix the problems we created from overthrowing governments in other countries, keeping nonviolent and mentally ill people in jails, sexually assaulting the elderly in airports, giving tax breaks to people who don't deserve or need them, and not nearly enough to fix the impossible national debt that threatens the nation's very existence.  None of these issues would occur in a direct democracy setting, and very few of these issues would occur if money and lobbyists were strictly barred from the political realm.  Can we make a page specifically to discuss the problems that the United States has with money in politics? rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[33m2605:A000:F2C0:A400:404:D21C:890A:A7EB: I think there needs to be an "America's got problems" page.  There can be a section on lobbyists, a section on citizens united, a section on laws being created in secret trade deals like the TPP, a section on unrestricted political campaign contributions, a section on corporate person-hood, etc. rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[34mPincrete: ''EllenCT''' firstly, apologies, the 'charts on income levels of US Senators' are in a link you made above not in THIS article, it was late when I wrote that and memory let me down when trying to think of an example of excessive detail. Where should this material be? I don't know as I am insufficiently knowledgeable about these pages and am only here at all by foolishly getting involved in tidying up some UK references. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mPincrete: I disagree with some other editors to this extent however, although these pieces of research may be recent, ''(and although they may or may not be the most authorative available)'', nevertheless, the argument as to whether the voter or powerful interest groups control a country is probably as old as time, as is the argument as to whether political decisions are made to benefit the country/populace or simply in the interest of those powerful groups ''(Government of/by/for the economically powerful)''. Therefore this page could legitimately report that this debate exists, we don't have to take sides or to wait until the majority of economic/political commentators agree on the subject. On a related point - for a variety of reasons - no state has ever described itself as a plutocracy, so if we aren't careful, we will inevitably come to the conclusion that no state is/was or has ever been described as plutocratic, except those of which every potential defender has long since disappeared into history. rebuttal_labels::
