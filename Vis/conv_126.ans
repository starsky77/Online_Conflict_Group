[31mWarKosign: Out of the 3 sources, one says "settlers were imbued with the idea of returning to the old-new land, to a specific national territorial goal" and the second says "that Jews had a deep and vital historical connection to the land was essential to asserting the right to resettle in it" - nothing about Jews originating in the land, only about returning (presumably after being expelled). Do you have a source that supports your new statement about Jews originating in the Land of Israel ? rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mNo More Mr Nice Guy: That sentence is describing what Zionists think, so it doesn't matter if it's a myth or not (and it's much less of a myth than you'd like it to be, but that's neither here nor there). You don't get to push your POV on other people's thoughts. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mBenjil: I am very happy that "you know" that the expulsion of Jews from Judea was a myth, but your personal opinion, unrelated to the facts, is of no interest to us. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mWarKosign: Please don't tell me what I know. Or maybe it was a royal we ? Your personal opinions are irrelevant. Here we go by sources, and while you may not like it, the sources say that the Zionists were motivated by the Jewish diaspora. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[34mBenjil: I don't even understand the logic of your question. This is a false dichotomy. There is no contradiction between the fact that the jews originated from there and wanted to return to it after having been expelled/exterminated/ and forced to leave by the Romans. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[36mDailycare: I'm also OK with saying "motivated by the diaspora", although that seems less faithful to the cited sources than "originating" or "left". Concerning the myth of exile, it is not my personal opinion but the consensus opinion of serious historical scholarship in the matter: â™¥No Return, No Refuge (Howard Adelman, Elazar Barkan, p. 159): "in the popular imagination of Jewish history, in contrast to the accounts of historians or official agencies, there is a widespread notion that the Jews from Judea were expelled in antiquity after the destruction of the temple and the "Great Rebellion" (70 and 135 CE, respectively). Even more misleading, there is the widespread, popular belief that this expulsion created the diaspora." â™¥Although the myth of an exile from the Jewish homeland (Palestine) does exist in popular Israeli culture, it is negligible in serious Jewish historical discussions.(Israel Bartal, dean of humanities at the Hebrew University) rebuttal_labels:: DH7: Refuting the central point
[31mWarKosign: In the popular imagination of Jewish history ... there is a widespread notion that the Jews from Judea were expelled in antiquity. This source supports the current statement in the lead perfectly, regardless of correctness of this notion. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mBenjil: If you are speaking about the idea that the Diaspora started at the time of the destruction of the Temple, of course this is a myth, and a Christian one, not a Jewish one (Jews were perfectly aware of this fact). Many Jews, probably the majority, already lived in Diaspora at the time. Regarding the Jews that did live in Judea at the time, many were slaughtered during the wars with Rome, in fact, most of them as Cassius Dio wrote after the Bar Kokhva revolt and as shown by archeology and other testimonies. Many were taken as slaves (around 100,000 according to Josephus) during the first war; Many of the remaining Jews left after, because of the ongoing persecutions, special taxes, land grabbing etc... rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[36mDailycare: WarKosign, that source doesn't discuss "advocates of Zionism" or "national liberation movement" at all, so no, the source doesn't support the statement. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument

[33mMakeandtoss: Now you are referring to fringe theories. As I said for the '''millionth''' time, we are '''not''' saying that this was/is Zionism, we are saying that this was a PART of Zionism in its '''earliest''' stages. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mNo More Mr Nice Guy: Yesterday you said that "Zionism once strove towards the establishment of a Jewish state outside of Palestine", but today you're ''not'' saying that "this was/is Zionism"? Cool. Anyhow, I didn't say anything about fringe theories, just noted that UNDUE is not about size. By the way, I don't have access to "Schreiber, Mordecai. ''The Shengold Jewish Encyclopedia'', 2003. Page 291". Could you please post some of the text there so we can see there's no COPYVIO? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[33mMakeandtoss: Yes I did say that, I wanted to say part of Zionism. WP:UNDUE says "Giving due weight and avoiding giving undue weight mean that articles should not give minority views or aspects as much of or as detailed a description as more widely held views or widely supported aspects" Does the 295 to 177 votes in the Uganda Scheme look like a minority view to you?!? I copied that text from a Wikipedia article, I just tried to paraphrase it, just in case... rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH5: Counterargument
[32mNo More Mr Nice Guy: So you've never actually laid eyes on the source you put in the article, and are paraphrasing "just in case"? That's awesome. Please read WP:SAYWHEREYOUGOTIT. You also obviously don't understand what "minority views" means. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
