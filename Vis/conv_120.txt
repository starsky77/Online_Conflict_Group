{'text': 'Who says that her membership of the Socialist Party is a "previous political affiliation"? Is there anything to say that is is not a continuing membership? Membership of one organisation does not preclude membership of others. IMHO, it can be reasonably asserted that she is currently a member of the Socialist Party, Solidarity (previously AAA) and Solidarity-PBP. It is, after all, a well -known tactic of Troyskyists to decant themselves into organisations with less frightening names in order to subvert them to the true aims of Trotskyism. Ms Coppinger seems to be a good practitioner of the art. It would require a high degree of naivety to say otherwise.', 'username': 'Laurel Lodged', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': "I think this is probably the most neutral way of wording the article, which after all is a biography of a living person. We would need a very reliable source to verify her membership of the party before we could add it here. Most of the sources I've found have referred to her as a socialist rather than as a member of the Socialist Party â€“ there is a difference. But if you believe she is still a member of the Socialist Party and want her article to say as much, then you need to find evidence of that.", 'username': 'This is Paul', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH4: Stating your stance'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'I agree with Laurel Lodged. Coppinger is a member of the Socialist Party, she has also joined the AAA, now Solidarity, and also Solidarity-PBP. As Laurel Lodged said, she can be a member of more than one organisation. There is no evidence that she left the Socialist Party. If she did leave it, it\'s up to you to provide a reliable reference stating this fact. Looking at her twitter profile: "Solidarity TD for Dublin West, Socialist Party member, Member of Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government & Committee on the 8th Amendment".

{'text': 'Unfortunately her twitter post can\'t be used as a reliable source, and the statement on there is ambiguous anyway. There is no doubt she was a member of the Socialist Party, but is she stating that she still is a member of that party, or is she merely acknowledging that she was in the past. The nature of political parties tends to be that there\'s an assumption with "membership" that, unless specified by inter-party agreement, a person cannot be a member of two parties that operate in the same area. If you believe that\'s different in Ruth Coppinger\'s case, then I\'m afraid the onus is on either yourself or Laurel Lodged to prove she is still a member of the Socialist Party, at least if you wish to add that information anyway. It\'s not for me to prove why it shouldn\'t be included, and if you don\'t supply reliable sources to back up the statement then the information will just be removed again, either by me or someone else. Sorry if you don\'t like that, but this is an encyclopedia, and any statements added here need to be supported with reliable sources.', 'username': 'This is Paul', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': "No, the onus is on you. You are asserting that she has left the Socialist Party, therefore it is up to you to prove this is so. Please provide a reliable reference for your assertions. For example, Clare Daly was previously a member of the Socialist Party but left in 2012. There are plenty of reliable references for this. If, as you also claim, that Coppinger has left the SP, then it shouldn't be too hard to find references for this assertion.", 'username': 'Spleodrach', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'Let\'s see if I can explain this clearly. People don\'t usually belong to more than one political party. Joining a new party usually means that the person concerned will have left their previous party (see Crossing the floor and Party switching for example). There are some exceptions to that status quo, and if that is the case here and you wish to say as much then you need to provide evidence. That means finding sources, which you can post here. That doesn\'t mean making sweeping statements like "There are plenty of reliable references for this". That being the case then it shouldn\'t be too difficult for you to find them then, should it? And it is your responsibility to do that. It\'s not mine. I\'m not the one who wants to add the information. If you\'re unhappy with my thoughts on this you\'re welcome to seek a third opinion, or take it to WP:DRN. In fact, I highly recommend you do that, because if you continue with this silly argument, then I will seek the opinion of others.', 'username': 'This is Paul', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument', 'DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument', 'DH3: Policing the discussion'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'Paul, it would be worth your while having a wee read of Entryism. The pertinent bit is "is a political strategy in which an organisation or state encourages its members or supporters to join another, usually larger, organisation in an attempt to expand influence and expand their ideas and program. In situations where the organization being "entered" is hostile to entrism, the entrists may engage in a degree of subterfuge and subversion to hide the fact that they are an organisation in their own right.". As  and I have been patiently trying to explain to you, this is what extreme socialists engage in. As you might expect, they of course deny that they engage in it. Ms Coppinger is an entrist. You will find no confession from her stating that this is her cunning strategy. As people close to the political situation here in Ireland, you can take it that Spleodrach & I know what we\'re talking about. So that puts the onus back on you to find a source saying that she has resigned from her multiple party organisations. Trust us - you won\'t find any.', 'username': 'Laurel Lodged', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': "Aah, nothing like the old I'm an expert argument when all else fails. Oh, and thanks for the quick lesson in Irish politics (now deleted I see). Now to the matter in hand. If you really won't find any sources discussing Ruth Coppinger's apparent subterfuge, then you can't add any allegations of it here. It's a violation of WP:BLP (which you might both want to read incidentally), and as someone with over 100,000 edits, I would have expected better from , but there you have it. BTW, I am of Irish descent, and have relatives living in Ireland, so I do know a little bit about Irish politics. Obviously I'm not an expert like yourselves.
