{'text': 'Yes, I reverted the section once: revision 800729830. I usually revert when I see contributions that amount to patent nonsense. I cannot possibly fix these myself and a reversion is usually educational. An editor, be it , myself or anyone else, must always preview – or at least review – his own edit. Lynton1 did not realize that his contribution is broken and is not rendered as he intended. I did.\nYou see, I (and nobody else) care to what extent WP:CALC is stretched as long as the explanation is clear, conscise and well-worded. (Believe me, you wouldn\'t.) This contribution was the opposite: I read the first paragraph, understood nothing, and run into "does provide a beautiful symmetry", which is subjective, contains peacock terms and forbidden in Wikipedia. On the top of it, I ran into a broken image. (Wikipedia does not display an image from an external source. We take the use of non-free images very seriously.) And when I load it in another tab manually, I don\'t see symmetry (beautiful or otherwise) but congruity. Traversing the subsequent sentences is like crossing a minefield. I run into:\nprobability unknown (then how do you know it?)\ncitation to be provided (in plain text)\n (broken template)\nthis is a truly beautiful scenario with an incalculable probability? Are there any super quants out there to calculate this?! (what iritates and confuses me the most is the question mark! While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, in the case, the beholder\'s eye isn\'t certain and the beholder himself sees fit to write this incertainty multiply incertainty.)\nIn practice, a good player can achieve a win-rate of 57%+ (player vs computer over 100 games). A win rate of 56% has been verified by an addict with a continuous recorded game history exceeding 7000 games. This sentence has done a superb job of doing exactly what must \'\'\'NOT\'\'\' be done in Wikipedia, as mandated by WP:5P.\nAnd then,  goes ahead and counter-reverts my reversion, without an edit summary, as if I am a vandal!\nhas put up a valiant effort to restore the low quality contents but unfortunately, the quality of the result is so poor, that I am sure if Unscintillating had reviewed, he\'d have rejected it.\nBest regards,', 'username': 'Renamed user 2560613081', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Providing clarification']}
