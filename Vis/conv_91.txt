{'text': 'The article section on product and research goes to great pains to make it sound like the polyphenols in Monavie have no benefit in vivo.  This is in direct contradiction to Wikipedia\'s own article titled "Antioxidant effect of polyphenols and natural phenols"  where the anti-inflammatory benefits of polyphenols and other benefits in vivo are reported.

{'text': 'Here is direct quote from Wikipedia article "Antioxidant effect of polyphenols and natural phenols." Consuming dietary polyphenols may be associated with effects in higher animal species:\n- Possible reduction in inflammation such as in coronary artery disease[6][7] including specific research on endothelial cells via downregulation of oxidative LDL.[8]\n- Other possible effects may result from consumption of foods rich in polyphenols, but are not yet proved scientifically in humans so are not allowed as health statements by regulatory authorities like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Among these are possible anti-aging effects in skin.[9] Further research may discern if polyphenol antioxidants have biological roles in vivo.[10][11]\nCould substitute above paragraph for the paragraph on polyphenols in the Monavie article.', 'username': 'Tonyhammond', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
{'text': 'No. We are not going to violate WP:MEDRS to help you push your overpriced fruit juice with weasel-worded nonsense. \'Not scientifically proven\' means exactly what it says. As for \'further research\', this would be a lot easier if companies like MonaVie told their customers just how much \'antioxidant\' there actually was in the product. And BTW, we don\'t cite our own articles as sources - though if we did, your cherry-picked interpretation of the article wouldn\'t be acceptable anyway. It quite specifically states that "caution should be exercised in attempting diets depending largely on dietary supplements as opposed to a broad array of food sources, since the quality and concentrations of beneficial chemicals in some commercial products is subject to question".', 'username': 'AndyTheGrump', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH7: Refuting the central point', 'DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument', 'DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': "Did not and would not suggest violating any reliable source criteria. Further, am not suggesting you use one Wiki article to support another.  However, the sources cited in that article are just as valid for the Monavie article if addressing polyphenols.  My point is that the current Monavie article is highly biased in a negative way and the other article is more balanced and more accuratepresenting both sides of the issue.  The sources cited in the polyphenol article are more credible and there is a preponderance of scientific evidence now available to suggest that the Monavie article is erroneous, biased, and violates Wikipedia's criteria that articles be balanced, unbiased and not push someone's personal agenda.  It seems like someone here is pushing an anti-MonaVie agenda rather than one of presenting a balanced, unbiased view.  If you can't support presenting a balanced, unbiased view, then I recommend dropping the paragraph entirely.", 'username': 'Tonyhammond', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}

{'text': 'Not pushing a pro-MonaVie agenda, but I am disconcerted with the anti-Monavie agenda that you and others seem to be promoting.  I am just trying to understand why it is okay to malign a product with articles that do not refer to the product but instead refer to components of the product, but it is not okay to refute those erroneous statements with more recent scientific evidence.  Is Wikipedia about presenting the truth or your agenda?  As early as 2005 the Journal of Clinical Nutrition was reporting on the benefits of and anti-inflamatory properties of polyphenols...here is one article from 2005 other, more recent articles abound...Polyphenols: antioxidants and beyond,Augustin Scalbert, et al, an excerpt from the abstract is below:\nResearch on the effects of dietary polyphenols on human health has developed considerably in the past 10 y. It strongly supports a role for polyphenols in the prevention of degenerative diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases and cancers. The antioxidant properties of polyphenols have been widely studied, but it has become clear that the mechanisms of action of polyphenols go beyond the modulation of oxidative stress....it seems to me the outdated references in the article should be replaced with more recent scientific evidence.  â€” Preceding unsigned comment added by', 'username': '96.28.85.164', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}
