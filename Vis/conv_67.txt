{'text': 'I have added two NPOV-Section tags to this article, in two places where there are direct links offsite to papers specifically written by John Lott, hosted on a site that I am not sure has recognition with Wikipedia as being a credibly neutral site for information.  Given that the articles directly expand on the short additions to Wikipedia that link to them, it would appear that this is an attempt at self-promotion rather than abiding by the NPOV rules of Wikipedia.  That is the reason I have added these tags.', 'username': 'Whisperwolf', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Providing clarification']}
{'text': 'On further reading of the entire article I have nominated this article for a POV-check since there are a lot of occasions where it is stated "Lott found..." as if his own research results should be taken as fully accurate.  Since there is evident political bias in some of the items I do consider that the balance of the article overall is straying away from NPOV and would therefore invite discussion as to the overall neutrality of this article.  While I accept that "(researcher) found" can be accurate in some cases, since there is obvious political bias and some of Lott\'s work is controversial, I feel it is inappropriate for such terms to be used with the frequency that they are in this article, without some balance of opposite political views.', 'username': 'Whisperwolf', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
{'text': 'First, these are published academic articles.  The abortion article was published in the economics journal Economic Inquiry.  Second, if there is subsequent academic research that directly comments on this research you can cite it and state what it claims.  Third, the statements saying "Lott found . . ." seems unbiased.  It is stating that "Lott" had found the finding.  It is not saying that all academics state the same finding.  Finally, other posting by other academics are written in similar ways  see the postings on Steven Levitt.', 'username': 'Serenity~enwiki', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'While I can appreciate what you say on the subject of "Lott found..." I still feel that to link directly to his papers crosses the line of WP:NOR which specifically states:\nWikipedia articles should rely on reliable, published secondary sources. All interpretive claims, analyses, or synthetic claims about primary sources must be referenced to a secondary source, rather than original analysis of the primary-source material by Wikipedia editors.\nPrimary sources that have been published by a reliable source may be used in Wikipedia, but only with care, because it is easy to misuse them. For that reason, anyone—without specialist knowledge—who reads the primary source should be able to verify that the Wikipedia passage agrees with the primary source. Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation. To the extent that part of an article relies on a primary source, it should:\nonly make descriptive claims about the information found in the primary source, the accuracy and applicability of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable, educated person without specialist knowledge, and\nmake no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, explanatory, or evaluative claims about the information found in the primary source.\nClearly in directly linking to a paper rather than having a reference link to a third party reliable source, this section breaches Wikipedia\'s Guidelines.  If something was published elsewhere, and that elsewhere is a credible source, then the article here should link to that credible source, not direct to the paper.', 'username': 'Whisperwolf', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'I\'m trying to decide what to do with the section on Lott et al. researching media bias. The whole paragraph is poorly written. For instance, what does "how to objectively measure what the actual news story was" even mean? I guess they mean they are measuring something about an \'\'event\'\' covered by a newspaper, but what about it was measured? It seems to only suggest that the media presents events with a political tilt of some kind, but without a clearer summary, I think this should be cut.', 'username': 'Threepillars', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
