[31m39.47.121.0: Election 2014 rebuttal_labels:: 
[31m39.47.121.0: Hello Friends ! in compliance with WP policies, i want a dispute resolution by some neutral WP admin. It all started when i first time read this article i found the following wording in the lead paras;
However, elections held in 2014 saw highest voters turnout in 25 years of history in Kashmir.European Union also welcomed elections, called it free and fair" and congratulated India for its democratic system.The European Parliament also takes cognizance of the fact that a large number of Kashmiri voters turned out despite calls for the boycott of elections by certain separatist forces.
It looked out of place in the lead because this election dealt only 45% land area of kashmir state which is disputed between india, Pakistan and China. It also looked pro india because it ignored wining pro india chief minister and wining party head comments giving credit to Pakistan and separatists for allowing elections in the state. so i inserted it with indian source reference as follows.
However, elected Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Muhammad Sayeed said, "If God forbid the Hurriyat and the militants tried to disrupt the elections these would not have been as participative as they had been. They (Pakistan) also allowed these elections to take place." Ruling Party president Mehbooba Mufti also defended Mufti's remarks. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31m39.47.121.0: Then what happened could be seen in detail on page history. Different tactics were used to remove these lines. My question to all my friends is "Are we good faith neutral WP community or "Are we like fraud lawyers who manipulate rules/law to achieve their goals. Might is right Or right is right ? Thanks. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mKautilya3: First of all, the lead is a quick summary of the article, highlighting the important ideas. There was already too much detail regarding the 2014 election, and you were adding a lot more, verbatim quotes from news reports. In general, you should add material to the article and then summarize it in the lead if it is sufficiently important. Other editors should agree with your judgement about the importance and, if they don't agree, you should discuss it on the talk page. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mKautilya3: I have now condensed the lead, while keeping your citation. Please feel free to add more discussion in the body. Please keep in mind however that this is an article about the Kashmir conflict, not an article on the 2014 election. There is a separate article for that. If you really want to do service to Kashmiris, consider creating similar articles on elections in Azad Kashmir - rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mFaizan: Yup, detail should be added to the separate article as it does not cover 70 years of history. But mention of Pakistan is required too. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mCosmicEmperor: The news is not too important for this article, you can add this in the page
Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election, 2014  but not in this particular page., and kautilya you don't have to be too much over the top neutral. Â  rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mHuman3015: , No need to add "separatists does not tried to disrupt elections", because there are numerous sources where separatist hurriyat leaders appealed to boycott elections. There is difference between "separatists" and "militants". Separatists are more like political activist which often pelts stones but does not categorise as militants and they have done their best to appeal people regarding boycott of recent elections and also they appealed shut down on various elections days. So word "separatist" should not be included in lead stating that they didn't disrupted election. But "militants" are those who use arms and do terror attack, though there was no such major terror incidence during elections still we can't say that its because of Pakistan was not willing to do any attack or they could not do it because of strong security during elections. Still mufti thanked Pakistan for that, he thanked militants. There are clear cut evidences that political separatists tried to disrupt the elections.Â â€¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mKautilya3: I am not being "over the top neutral." The IP made a good argument and convinced me that this is an important part of the "Kashmir conflict" as it exists today, and so it should be highlighted. Pakistanis want credit for not disrupting elections in the neighbouring country. Dubious honour though it is, they should get it. That is part of the conflict. - rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mHuman3015: , its ok if Pakistan wants credit, but does Mufti is reliable source to give credit to Pakistan for smooth conduct of elections and writing it in lead? Give me one more independent source other than Mufti's statement giving credit to Pakistan. As one user said, Mufti's this statement can be written in Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election, 2014 not in lead of parent article of Kashmir conflict. Election commission of India, EU, UN officials,US officials congratulated India for smooth conduct of elections, who congratulated Pakistan? Mufti's statement came after his alliance with Hindu nationalist party BJP and he just wanted to show his voters that his ideology is not same like BJP and he is "Pro-Pakistani". So its just politically motivated statement. And we are writing it in lead of parent article. Â â€¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mKautilya3: Yes, the views of Mufti, the elected Chief Minister, can be stated with ''inline attribution'' for the current affairs of which he had direct knowledge. (This is different from Narendra Modi claiming to have known what "every Indian" thought when he was 21 years old.) - rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mCosmicEmperor: Doesn't matter what Mufti says: You like the statement of that IP then add it to Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election, 2014. You very well know terrorists and separatists will always try their level best to disrupt elections; but they were not successful as BSF, CRPF and Indian Army did their best to stop Pakistani terrorists from entering Kashmir. Now in a similar situation, are you going to add these following reliable references in the wiki page of Taj Mahal?

[32mKautilya3: Sorry, I don't agree. Elections being free and fair is important, which is why the EU people mentioned it.  I think the due weightage in the last paragraph is quite fine. In a few months, we will get scholarly articles covering the election, when we can update the write-up based on them. Cheers, rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[33m39.47.50.14: Kautilya3 no need for you saying sorry because that is your opinion about what is important for you. But here we are discussing what should be in the lead. What if against european union certificate some one put Pakistan China and 56 countries OIC members declaring elections not a substitute of plebiscite giving kashmiries right of self determination. Therefore these EU certification for your kind satisfaction should be only in election 2014 separate article. Lead should be crisp as you earlier pointed out and should be stating turnover was good and winner telling the reason. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[33m39.47.50.14: 115.186.146.225 agreed 100% sir;  better try playing video games;  good thought friend but there are so many things which are important but we can not write a movie in the lead; it should be brisk; As Sir 115.186.146.225 stated every one agreed that turnover improved so no need to add extra qualifier certificates on fairness or greatness of Indian democratic system by a regional economic depression hit union. Certificates are only pasted when confidence level of propagator is weak or his position is dubious in world eyes so he wants to hide truth with lipstick touch ups or their are different contradictory claims. On a serious note turnover was good and winner telling the reason is the shortest lead entry. More reliable the sources less dubious WP insertions will be specially on sensitive issues. Agree on  para from sir (115.186.146.225) rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[37m115.186.146.225: Yes sobia naz (39.47.50.14). Additionally Current statement in the lead " elections held in 2014 saw highest voter turnout in the last 25 years" is strange and just like Deceptive marketing tactic we usually face around the world where advertiser claims best or highest in this or that (with only  favorable comparisons) which is a malpractice and is tried to be forcefully denied by regulatory authorities. Please see relevant wikipedia article here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_advertising. In election under discussion Turn out was lowest compare to election in  other indian states even less then azad kashmir and gilgit baltistan, interestingly no one highlighted that. After detailed thinking and edit history pattern I feel this page is being controlled by few indian editors so all our Talk page consensus efforts will be denied by hook or crook. see current lead statment about election 2014 as example. I think if we were denied neutral consensus we have to consult arbitration committee. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mKautilya3: 115.186.146.225, importance is not attached to the sources and their views, but rather to the information that is stated. The fact that the elections were found to be free and fair is important.  The fact that the voter turnout was good is important. And, the fact that the separatists didn't cause disruption is important. It doesn't matter to me who said these things as long as they are reliable enough to be cited. - rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mCosmicEmperor: Question is, who are you?Â  rebuttal_labels:: DH0: Name calling/hostility
[37m115.186.146.225: CosmicEmperor I do not agree with you statement against Kautilya3 for him showing neutrality.As far what i understand WP policies such instructions to others may disqualify anyone from editing WP because WP has high ethic standards and great reputation. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH5: Counterargument
[37m115.186.146.225: I agree with Faizan and Kautilya3 and feel that wining CM's statement who represent the state where elections were held is very important in this context. I also agree with Kautilya3 view that lead should short so I propose removal of European union and European parliament statements on following grounds
1. In the presence of European union note why to put extras like European parliament note or EU any other administrative unit/ department note.
2. Election had improved turnout as per one party (India) which was never denied by other party (Pakistan or Separatist) so there is no need for certificate service from European Union because no party dis agreed to this statement.
3. As far  European Union certificate of democracy to india is concerned that is not relevant in this artical.
4. European Union is neutral but it is not Pakistan or Pro pakistan separatist it is wining pro india CM by his own self is denying EU. so rival credit by default nullifies EU allegations.
So in order to shorten lead the whole para should be read like this. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance

2	2015-06-12 09:22:16	Kautilya3	 115.186.146.225, you made a good argument at the top, which I took into account. However, now, you are POV pushing. Do you have a reliable source that questions the statement that the election turnout was the highest in 25 years, or is it your own original research? -  					False

7	2015-06-12 10:09:35	115.186.146.225	 Any one can see how POV push had been in edit history. Deceptive marketing like tactics and misuse of WP policies will induce me to refer to arbitration committee who will be in better position to judge with nuetral mind.  					False

5	2015-06-12 10:24:32	Human3015	Dear IPs, election turnout was highest since 1989 (the year when armed insurgency started in Kashmir). What advertising you are seeing in it? If you have some problem with content then try to resolve it here on talk page, later you can also go to dispute resolution board. Arbitration is last board to apply and this so obvious information don't even deserve long discussion on this talk page itself. You have to keep your nationalist and personal thoughts out of Wikipedia while editing. Don't waste time of community for such minor issues. Inclusion of remarks of EU and voters % are obvious facts and it should be included. You can challenge any un-sourced and non-relevant content but here it is highly sourced and relevant. Thank you.Â â€¢					False
