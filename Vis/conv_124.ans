[31mSzqecs: The '''rank being second''' is a fringe theory because, as I said, is based on estimate figures. The last census was in 2010. All other figures are estimates. If the estimates only differ by 300 out of 2.7 million, Taichung being second is for sure a fringe theory, as the sources I cited suggests otherwise. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mMultivariable: So now you're saying figures that Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior put out aren't reliable enough? You don't get to pick and choose which sources you want to acknowledge: up-to-date government figures & announcements  vs. unrelated news articles citing conventional (and perhaps outdated) wisdom (see WP:CHERRYPICK). And you certainly don't get to decide whether something is a fringe theory (WP:OR). The MOI announcement dated 4 August 2017 states: rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mMultivariable: Also, you've been changing your own argument. Initially, you posted that you didn't want any mention of Taichung's population in the lede (due to MOS:INTRO). Then you said the ranking couldn't be mentioned because there wasn't a reliable source. But now, it's alright to mention as long as Taichung is ranked 3rd instead of 2nd? ; rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mSzqecs: Yes I am saying that. If, say, in the past month 300 people in Taichung went hiking and died, and they have no relatives so their deaths are unknown, they would still be included in these estimate figures. The only way to know for sure which has a higher population is to do a census. I haven't changed my argument, but maybe named this section inaccurately. The population number is fine but not the rank, because the difference is 0.01%. They are effectively the same. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mSzqecs: Let me remind you that I am not arguing about which city is actually bigger. I am arguing what should be written and in what manner. If "outdated" wisdom is still prevalent, articles still need to reflect it. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mSzqecs: And I already cited 3 sources saying Kaohsiung is second. Who are you to say those are invalid? rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mMultivariable: The most recent, up-to-date government statistics say Taichung's population has exceeded that of Kaohsiung. The articles you cited make '''no''' mention of Taichung at all. I already explained above why government figures/announcements are more verifiable than unrelated news articles about typhoons. And why do you consider Taiwanese government figures invalid? The burden is on you to show that the articles you cited are referencing a more appropriate or up-to-date source (WP:PROVEIT). Also, why keep removing ''any'' mention of population in the lead? You already agreed that the issue was stating Taichung's rank, not about mentioning population in general. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH5: Counterargument
[31mSzqecs: WP:VERIFY doesn't even mention government announcements. I don't know where you got that idea. Also you clearly ignored my previous reply. Per WP:UNDUE, "Neutrality requires that each article or other page in the mainspace fairly represent all significant viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources". If you absolutely must mention rank, you must write it in a way that reflects the fact that it is not a widespread view. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mMultivariable: Exactly! All I've asked is: If you have a better source than a MOI government announcement, please provide it. You keep bringing up articles about typhoons that don't mention Taichung (or its population or rank) at all. How you consider these articles to be "significant viewpoints" is unclear. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mSzqecs: What do you mean by "better"? Per Neutrality below WP:YTCOPYRIGHT "All articles must adhere to NPOV, fairly representing all majority and significant-minority viewpoints published by reliable sources, in rough proportion to the prominence of each view." I don't know how else to explain this to you. Kaohsiung being second is a significant-minority view, if not majority, and it contradicts with the proposed statement that Taichung is second. If you must write about it, you must reflect that. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH5: Counterargument
[32mMultivariable: Continue reading: "If there is disagreement between sources, use in-text attribution: 'John Smith argues that X, while Paul Jones maintains that Y,' followed by an inline citation." Ok, ''who'' maintains that Kaohsiung still has the 2nd largest population in Taiwan and ''why'' is it significant? Where are they getting this view from, and (in light of the recent announcement) why are they maintaining that it's ''not'' Taichung? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mSzqecs: Or just not mention it and avoid all the trouble. As I said, it is already in the infobox. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMultivariable: Oh, it's OK to state that Taichung is ranked 2nd in the infobox, but if it's mentioned elsewhere, all of the sudden it's WP:NPOV, WP:UNDUE, WP:FRINGE, etc.? I'm fine with all the "trouble"; I've already provided the sources to state it. Like I said, the burden is on you to state otherwise. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mSzqecs: Yes. Putting it in the infobox is giving it little weight so as to not be undue. Simply stating it is second would be giving it undue weight, unless it is written with balanced views per WP:BALANCE. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mMultivariable: I think we might need a third opinion here (WP:3O). If you don't mind, I'm going to go ahead and request one. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMultivariable: At the very least, I think the population should be mentioned in the lead. And I think the statement that it's the second largest city in Taiwan is fine, based on the MOI reference cited by Multivariable. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mPhlar: subject." You're trying to argue ''against'' a government source that says Taichung's population is now ranked 2nd in Taiwan. To counter, you need a source that says, "Yes, the MOI released new figures that show that Taichung's population is now larger than Kaohsiung's, but (I disagree/the figures are wrong) because X." Otherwise, this is just you being unhappy about what a source states, saying that it needs to be "balanced", while ''still'' refusing to provide a relevant source to support your opinion. Unless you do so, there's really no point in continuing to argue about NPOV, undue weight, fringe theories, etc. when you continually refuse to provide a reliable source to begin with. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mMultivariable: I'm glad you mentioned WP:BALANCE, because it asks you evaluate this with respect to the "body of reliable, published material on the  rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mSzqecs: Or, you could just quote your super reliable government announcement and write: "As of July 2017, Taichung city's population reached 2,778,182 people, its first time passing Kaohsiung city's 2,777,873 people. Of the 6 special municipalities (and all counties/cities), its population is second only to New Taipei's." If you are so attached to this source why not just quote it directly? rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mMultivariable: Sounds good, I'll just cite it! rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMultivariable: This  is extraneous wording. There's no need to mention Kaohsiung, its population, how many municipalities there are in Taiwan, or New Taipei. Like you mentioned previously, this info isn't notable enough to be in the lead section per MOS:INTRO. However, I am glad we were able to come to a consensus that Taichung's population rank is OK to be included in the lead section. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mSzqecs: Yes there is. The rank isn't notable at all but since you insist on writing about it you must write it accurately. rebuttal_labels::
