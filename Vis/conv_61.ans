[31mSaxophilist: Why do you keep adding those pieces to the Saxophone page? I have never heard of them and I have never even seen them mentioned before. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mHstokar: I have not used 'talk' before so I hope this reaches you.  I am sorry that you personally do not know the Wuorinen works - but they are indeed major contributions to the repertoire.  I can give you names of a dozen players that can confirm this. Both published by CF Peters.   The Concerto - written for the Raschers and performed throughout Europe and the US, and the duo hundreds of times throughout the world by many players (there are at least two recordings so far).  If you are inclding Glass, Denisov and Husa others should be added (that you are not aware of).  Isn't that the point of wikipedia?   Also any sax player interested in 20th century music would immediately think of the Webern and the Wolpe...but maybe they need to be in a separate section, major chamber works?
Another major composition I just thought of Tristan Keuris - his Saxophone Quartet Concerto and Sax Quartet have been widely performed, and are very highly regarded. And what about the Berio Sequenza IXb for alto saxophone (1981)?
Finally on solos in orchestra works I'm sure some of the Del Tredici 'Alice' piece have such but I need to confirm with the publisher Boosey and Hawkes. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mSaxophilist: Hello, I have never heard of the Wourinen, Harbison, Halffter, Keuris, Babbit, or Florio pieces. Can you please show me that they are standards in the repertoire and that they were recorded by well-known saxophonists before we include them? Are any of these pieces experimental or atonal? I have heard of the Xenakis and Berio pieces. The Xenakis could stay, but I think that should be the only piece of experimental or atonal music included in the article. I think I'll add the Muczynski pieces to the article. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mSaxophilist: Also, I will be creating a section for quartet pieces. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mHstokar: You keep using the word 'standard works' and I am not sure what that means - title of the list is 'major works.'  The Harbison was premiered by 100 players simultaneously (for example).  Ask the Rascher Quartet about the Halffter, Wuorinen and Keuris.  The fact that you have not heard of them does not mean they should be excluded from such a list.   Check with some players that specialize in contemporary music - such as John Sampen, Ken Radnofsky, Harry White.... Please do not keep removing the additiona I have made  My expertise is in contemporary music.  These are carefully considered additions. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mSaxophilist: Are any of them experimental or atonal? Also, the list is supposed to be short and contain only the most well-known pieces in the repertoire. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mHstokar: the rep is growing far more extensively now with many excellent players and ensembles commissioning and championing new works.  My additions are all 'major' additions to the rep. Also an idication that some of the finest composers of our day are writing for the instruments. No idea what you mean by atonal - unless you are specifically referring to work such as those written by Schoenberg before he adopted the so called ;'12-tone system'?  As for experimental that is too broad a term.  I have no idea what it means musically. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mSaxophilist: XAS is an example of experimental music. Are any of the pieces you listed experimental? Also, the works you added are not standards in the repertoire yet. It might take many years before they become standards, if they ever even do. Until then, they should not be in the list. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34m74.73.161.77: Again not sure what you mean by experimental.  That is not a technical term.   If you want to list 'standards' change the name of the list to reflect that and delete the Glass, Densov.  Do you prefer I start a list titled Repertoire?  This this is a wiki page - should allow other input. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mSaxophilist: Stuff that sounds like this is considered to be experimental: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QBeCC5DJ4c. Stuff that sounds like a bunch of noise and with multiphonics and other odd things. Experimental music is not in the standard repertoire. Only a few players play that stuff. Also, the Glass and the Denisov ''are'' standards. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mHstokar: sorry but you seem to know little about contemporary music.  I've listed major works by major living rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mSaxophilist: I'm sorry, but most of the works you added are not standards in the repertoire. They might be standards one day, but right now they aren't. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mHstokar: list is titled MAJOR works.  These are all major works. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mSaxophilist: Hello, thank you for your contributions. I have done some research and found out several of the pieces you added are indeed standards in the repertoire. Others, however, are not standard. I will edit accordingly. Thanks again. Also, I will re-title the section "Standard works of the repertoire". rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mSaxophilist: I also just made a list of saxophone quartets and added some of your suggestions. If you think I'm missing a quartet, just let me know. Thank you. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mHstokar: I think using the word 'standard' or 'major' implies evaluations that are not universal.  I changed the title to 'Selected' so additional works can be added and it makes clear that the list is only a partial representation. rebuttal_labels::
