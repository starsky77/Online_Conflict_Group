[31mCinderella157: I would observe that the revert in the case of the McCain has left the article in an unsatisfactory state since it has removed the context for the action having occurred such that the reason for including the mention of the event appears meaningless.  In the case of the USS William P. Lawrence, the reverts have left the article in a better condition.  If I have this right, the consequences of the actions in each case have been stated in a single sentence. As I understand it, coat-racking is a matter of "undue weight". To quote from WP:COAT: "A coatrack article is a Wikipedia article that ostensibly discusses its nominal subject, but instead focuses on another subject entirely." I have suggested that the consequences of the act are of some significance to the article and, a single sentence of relevance to the subject article does not unduly shift the focus of the article.

[32mKendall-K1: I agree that this should go back in. rebuttal_labels::

[31mCinderella157: Hi, @ and @, this is a centralised discussion that also relates to a near identical issue wrt USS William P. Lawrence. It would be useful to make your views clear and explicit in this broader context.  Do you also agree that the material there should go back too? Regards rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mKendall-K1: I see there has already been a partial removal of material and a source citation. I have reverted this. I suggest we leave the material as-is until we arrive at consensus on the wording. rebuttal_labels::

[34mDavemck: s reasoning that this article is solely about the ship, not China's reaction, seems to me rather absurd (his "it's just too obvious that I'm in the right" is an alarm bell). Warships' ''raison d'Ãªtre'' is as instruments of foreign policy, and that would reasonably include both their activities and foreign governments' reactions to them. Certainly the issues could be treated at greater length elsewhere, but a sentence or two here with a wikilink to the fuller article is entirely appropriate. In any case, the consensus for including mention of China's reaction seems pretty clear by now: numerous editors vs. one. And if Wingwraith persists in edit warring, WP has well-developed procedures to deal with that. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mWingwraith: To be clear, I never said or implied that, what I said and was in fact trying to say was that my edits are better than the edits that  came up with. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mWingwraith: That's not my reasoning which, as you unwittingly intimate, is just besides the point. The question is the inclusion of state reactions to the ships' operational activities that have been documented in this article - which for good reasons (e.g. WP:COAT) has never been done before and for which neither you nor anybody else in this discussion has provided any good reason to justify this exception to the practice. As I implied in the preceding sub-category, since the state reaction pertain to the FONOPS, it belongs there and not to this article. You say that "Certainly the issues could be treated at greater length elsewhere, but a sentence or two here with a wikilink to the fuller article is entirely appropriate"; in that case, what would you have to object to this edit? Your final point about the consensus is misleading: it was about "the context for the action" not the inclusion of state reactions to the ships' operational activities. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mWingwraith: They're evidently good enough to you because you haven't reverted them. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mCinderella157: I have not done so because I believe it would be inappropriate to replicate such behavior at this juncture. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mWingwraith: Why the wait? Why don't we just debate whatever it is that we need to debate "at this juncture" and get it over with already? rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mCinderella157: The post which starts this section (and also mentioned in the previous section) indicates both a lack of context and the appropriateness of mentioning the consequences. @, you acknowledge a consensus wrt context but not consequences yet there is nothing in the consensus that would support your view wrt one but not both - pls see WP:NOTGETTINGIT. Being the case, what do you think would be a reasonable and appropriate response from the community at this juncture in regard to actioning this consensus? rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mWingwraith: I revised this article in the same way that I revised the Lawrence article which lead you to say that "In the case of the USS William P. Lawrence, the reverts have left the article in a better condition" so unless there's something specific about that which you object to it would just be a waste of time for me (and you) to continue this discussion. rebuttal_labels:: DH-1: Bailing out
