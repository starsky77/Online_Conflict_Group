[31mBenifb: Release Dates rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mBenifb: Someone has now put up 1up as their "source" for the April 15 release date. It should be noted that 1up originally said it would be March 15, then changed it to "Spring 2008" and now April 15, all without any announcements from Nintendo. I have no idea where they got this date from, but I think the release date should be kept to "Spring 2008" or "Q2 2008" until an OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT has been made. It's ridiculous that every time I open this page, there's a new NA release date; I even saw March 31 yesterday, which I had to correct since it didn't even make any sense, March 31 being before the already announced Japanese and European releases. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mLocke Cole: 1UP.com is Electronic Gaming Monthly which is a reliable source. Official announcements would actually not be usable on Wikipedia because they would be considered a primary source. Please see WP:V. â€” â€¢  â€¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mBenifb: 1up.com has been listing this date for a while now, even as Nintendo of America continues to say there has been no official announcement on the release date. What makes this April 15 date any more reliable than the March 15 date that 1up had previously listed as the release date? They changed it as soon as the Japanese and European releases were announced, when it became obvious that it wouldn't be coming out in NA in March. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mDVD Smith: It's nothing more than a logical guess. They probably assumed April 15th because it follows the same release pattern as Double Dash - released in Europe on the Friday, then in North America the following Tuesday. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mLocke Cole: This is all fascinating original research, but second guessing our sources isn't what we do on Wikipedia. We have a source saying April 15th, 2008, and that's what we should be reporting. Not individual editors "gut feelings". â€” â€¢  â€¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mZomic13: We should not have a date at all until we get an official announcement. The "sources" don't have a clue when the game is coming out any more than we do. Just look at them - we have a source that says April 15, April 28, May 1, June 1, and Q2 2008 All of those are reliable, trustworthy video game websites and they each list a different date. - rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mLocke Cole: Please see WP:RS, we use reliable sources. The only reliable source you quoted was 1up, which is Ziff-Davis/Electronic Gaming Monthly (an actual printed publication). Those other sources are indeed likely guessing. â€” â€¢  â€¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mZomic13: No, that is not true at all. IGN and Gamespot are just as reliable as 1up.com. - rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mLocke Cole: As reliable sources go, 1up is more reliable/credible than the others as it is the online incarnation of an actual physical publication. Again, see WP:V and WP:RS. â€” â€¢  â€¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mZomic13: First, a reliable source is a reliable source. Just because it also has a print publication doesn't make it any more reliable than a purely online site. If anything IGN is the most reliable site because of its dedicated Nintendo team that has close ties to Nintendo... Regardless though, the point is that none of the sites know for sure because the Nintendo has not officially revealed the date. Until Nintendo does, every site is just guess and we shouldn't list guesses, sourced or not. - rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH4: Repeated argument
[32mLocke Cole: Not true, we shouldn't list guesses made by editors, that would be original research on our part. Wikipedia routinely cites reliable sources best guesses though, and I see no reason why this situation should be any different. An "official announcement" is actually not something we would use on Wikipedia as it is considered a primary source unless the announcement was being reported by a secondary source (1UP, EGM, etc). â€” â€¢  â€¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mZomic13: By picking one reliable source over another we are essentially listing a guess made by you. I would agree with you if all of the reliable sources were listing the same date, but they are not. Thus the best course of action is to list the date as TBA. - rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mLocke Cole: But saying "TBA" is itself original research because we have a date with a reliable source. Do you see the issue? â€” â€¢  â€¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mZomic13: We have many different reliable sources each stating different dates. Do you see the issue? - rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mLocke Cole: But only one of those sources is available in print which is a hell of a lot more credible than a website (which literally anyone can make on their own). â€” â€¢  â€¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[36mZomic13: But IGN and Gamespot aren't websites that "just anyone made". They are legit businesses and their websites are entirely credible. Also, you're not even citing a print source - you're citing a website as well. Technically 1up.com isn't even the website for any print magazines - it's just part of the same games network under Ziff Davis Media, therefore it should fall under the same criticisms as any other website. - rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
