[31mBeenAroundAWhile: Mexicans, Pachucos, Chicanos and Latinos in Los Angeles rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mBeenAroundAWhile: I removed this section because it did not cite its sources. There was some good stuff in there, but this article already suffers severely from lack of sources, and there is no sense in adding even more information which may or may not be tru (but there is no way to check). Sincerely, rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mWill Beback: No way to check? The fact that Villaraigosa is the first Latino mayor since statehood is widely-cited. The Zoot Suit riots are the subject of articles, books, and even a movie. The demographic and protery shifts following statehood are also well-known. I agree that the article needs more sources, and even  a complete overhaul, but deleting undisputed information may not the be the best way to improve the article. This material was never even tagged for sources. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mBeenAroundAWhile: It's up to the editor or author who submits material to cite the sources up front, rather than be goaded into it, right? Maybe I have the drill wrong, but that is my understanding. We editors shouldn't have to clean up after unverified material is inserted into our encyclopedia. Anyway, that's my opinion. Am I wrong in this? Yours, rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mWill Beback: The aim here is to create an encyclopedia. These aren't weird or extraordinary assertions. Do you dispute any of them? Have you made any effort to verify them? Why did you pick that section to delete when the rest of the article doesn't have sources either?  I think it would be better to ask for help to improve the article rather than taking just deleting random material that doesn't have a citation. If the problem is too few sources then more sources are the answer, not deleting important events. Does that make sense? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mAgtaz: I had to step in because GL had removed some material that might have been true in other sections as well. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mBeenAroundAWhile: Thanks for your posting, Will_Beback, but the policy of Wikipedia is quite clear: The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truthâ€”that is, whether readers are able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether we think it is true. Editors should provide a reliable source for quotations and for any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged, or the material may be removed. To me, this means that ''the editor who added the material in the first place'' should be the one to provide the source (since he or she presumably has access to it or he wouldn't have added the info). It's not for the guy coming along afterward to clean up the mess. As for removing this section, I reverted it as soon as I noticed it on my watch list. There is some good material in it, some specious and tendentious stuff, but it must all be sourced. I trust you will agree with me on that latter anyway. Who was it that added this section? He or she should be willing to back up everything in here with a citation per WP policy. "Can't we all get along" in attempting to improve, not depreciate, this article about our fair city? Pretty firm on this, I remain, yours sincerely, rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mAgtaz: If you're going to delete that section, you might as well remove the other sections relating to race. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mWill Beback: It took some searching, but I found the origin of this material. It was added five years ago. Perhaps some folks weren't here then- back in those days very few inline references were added. In any case, it's been here for five years, with several fine editors copyediting or moving it, implictly endorsing its contents. If there's a specific part that is challenged then we can deal with that. There's no need to delete the parts that aren't challenged. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mBeenAroundAWhile: Thanks, Will_Beback, for your attention to detail. As for Agtax's snide comment, the less said the better. I will go through the section and attempt to find sources for the good parts, and I invite others to do the same. I recommend Leonard and Dale Pitts' ''Los Angeles From  A to Z'' as a good source. Unfortunately, in the haste of moving from L.A. to Frazier Park a few months ago I gave away my copy and have just now ordered another one from Amazon.com. When it arrives I'll get to work on making the fixes; in the meantime I have no objection to restoring the section. Yours sincerely, rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mBeenAroundAWhile: Oh, and thanks for writing  to the original author of the section in question. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mBeenAroundAWhile: I tried to find sources for the first statement of the section (that there were 200,000 Chicanos in L.A. in 1930) but could not do so. In 1930, foreign-born residents amounted to 15% of L.A.'s population, and in that year "Mexicans" were reclassified as "whites." This section, like others in this article, needs a lot of cleanup, so I added the extant tag thereto. Sincerely, rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mWill Beback: The original editor replied that some of the material came from "Carey McWilliams' histories of California". rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mWill Beback: It may have been:
'North from Mexico; the Spanish-speaking people of the United States.'' New York, Greenwood Press, 1968 [Â©1948]
It looks a bit old, but presumably accurate even so. There are a bunch of copies in my local library system; I'll see if I can get a copy. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mBeenAroundAWhile: The original editor also replied that most of his submission came from an organization he belongs to, the National Lawyers Guild, which is not an unbiased source, even though it does very fine work. Mind you, I have done volunteer service for that guild (monitoring the Demo convention in L.A.); it is an activist organization, and you can tell so from the original wording of the section in question. Sincerely, rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mWill Beback: Yes, that's where he said he got the pamphlet, which he thought came at least partly from the Williams book. If we can find the facts in that book then we can source the assertions to it directly, bypassing the "middleman". Some of the info, like the mayor being the first Latino, we chould be able to find in the L.A.T. archive or newer history books. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mAgtaz: It would appear that the rest of the sections after the Chicano section have been deleted as well. From going through the edits on this article, why is there so much debate on this section? rebuttal_labels::
