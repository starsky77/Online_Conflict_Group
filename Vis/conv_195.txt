{'text': "Of course. Firstly, Barry Cannon is a post-doctoral fellow at the school of law and government, Dublin City University, Ireland. His book ''Hugo Chávez and the Bolivarian Revolution: Populism and Democracy in a Globalised Age'' is published by Manchester University Press, an academic publishing company (hence the name). So, 1). The book is written by a professional academic. 2). It is published by an academic publishing house.\nSecondly, you ask for academic reviews:\nAmid often polemical and ideological discussion of the person and project of Hugo Chávez, Cannon's book offers a careful and broadranging examination of the context, causes and characteristics and consequences of Chavismo that provides a firm basis for a balanced assessment. Of particular significance is its excellent overview of Latin American populism and its clarification of the various dialogical hues it can adopt, thereby cutting through the dense fog that so often clouds discussion of this enduring political phenomenon. This book is a major contribution to the burgeoning literature on the ‘new left’ in Latin America.’  Professor Peadar Kirby, University of Limerick. (From back cover).''Cannon, Barry.
