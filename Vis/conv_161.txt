{'text': "I'd have to say that 90% of the edits to this article in the last year, outside of genre fiddling, have pertained to who is actually in Norma Jean right now — almost all of them have been unsourced changes. I'd like to place a template in the members section, maybe Template:Disputed, to let the readers know the information may not be accurate. As soon as Norma Jean's new album is publicly announced, there will be a press release explaining who is currently in the band and it will likely clear up any confusion that currently exists about former members. I imagine that will happen about two months from now, but for now, I think the readers should know by way of some disclaimer or template that the information could be false or outdated.

{'text': "First off, you should familiarize yourself with Wikipedia's Policies and Guidelines regarding a possible conflict of interest. In general, editing a subject that you're connected with is heavily frowned upon and could result in your account being blocked, depending on what you're contributing. It's generally recommend that editors who have a close connection just stick to commenting on talk pages, and not actually edit articles. Second, Wikipedia is supported by published, authoritative sources. Even if this is the '''true lineup''' of Norma Jean, Wikipedia would prefer to have some sort of published documentation supporting that. Please also familiarize yourself with Wikipedia's policy on Verification. That being said, are you, as the band's management, familiar with any published articles that discuss the current state of Norma Jean's lineup?", 'username': 'Fezmar9', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
