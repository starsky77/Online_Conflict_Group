{'text': 'The above sources would normally be good additions to the article if they weren\'t general survey sources that briefly mention Evangelos Zappas and the formation of the modern Olympics. Kaphetzopoulos, for example, focuses on the history of Northern Epirus and \'\'only lists\'\' the names of "Vlachs" (i.e., Aromanian-speaking Greeks) who contributed to Greece including Evangelos Zappas (Kaphetzopoulos, however, provides no details about the modern Olympics or even about Zappas\'s historic role in their development). As for Thomopoulos and Smerlas, they only provide a \'\'summary\'\' of Greek history with no references to primary or even secondary sources (no way to confirm where they\'re getting their information from). I don\'t really mind including an Aromanian origin for Zappas, but such an origin is technically fringe since mainstream scholars who\'ve studied the modern Olympics (i.e., Brownell, Decker, Gerlach, Hill, Landry, Landry, Yerlès, etc.) have already determined that Evangelos Zappas was a Greek.', 'username': 'Umpire Empire', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}

{'text': 'Greek media lies? Are you kidding me? First of all, "Vlachs" is a \'\'very broad term\'\' applied to different ethnic/linguistic groups with similar pastoral lifestyles. Kaphetzopoulos uses "Vlachs" to specifically refer to Aromanian-speaking Greeks (or perhaps just Greek pastoralists) based on the individuals he lists all of whom were Greeks or at least self-identified as Greeks. But regardless of what Kaphetzopoulos really means when he uses the word "Vlachs", the fact remains that Kaphetzopoulos \'\'only lists\'\' Zappas as a "Vlach" with no biographical details to substantiate the use of the label. So even if one can interpret the word "Vlachs" in Kaphetzopoulos as strictly meaning "ethnic Aromanians" (whatever that means), Kaphetzopoulos cannot be included in the entry since mainstream historians studying both Zappas and the modern Olympics have already determined that Zappas was a Greek (Zappas himself neither came from an Aromanian family nor self-identified as an "ethnic Aromanian"). And though I personally don\'t mind adding an Aromanian origin to the article, the inclusion of such an origin violates WP:FRINGE. So I kindly ask that you stop adding fringe nonsense and read the quality mainstream sources already in the article (i.e., Brownell, Decker, Gerlach, Hill, Landry, Landry, Yerlès) all of which describe and classify Evangelos Zappas as a Greek.', 'username': 'Umpire Empire', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH7: Refuting the central point'], 'coordination_labels': []}

You can't, which is why you keep peddling the weak sources (violating WP:RS and WP:FRINGE) that ''only mention'' Zappas's Aromanian origin without any biographical details to back up the claim. If you actually read the ''reliable sources'' in the entry that focus on Zappas's background, you'll see that ''none of them make any mention of Zappas being an Aromanian'' (if they did, then an Aromanian origin would have been included in the article months ago). So just accept the fact that Zappas was just a Greek and move on, because your unhealthy fixation on Zappas's ethnic origins is beginning to look a lot like disruptive trolling (WP:IDIDNTHEARTHAT).", 'username': 'Umpire Empire', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH4: Repeated argument', 'DH3: Policing the discussion', 'DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
