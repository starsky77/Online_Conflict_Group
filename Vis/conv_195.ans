[31mTuscumbia: Azerbaijani khanates rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mTuscumbia: Magotteers, the source () clearly says the khanates were Azerbaijani and the line in the article clearly says ''Caucasian khanates or the northern Azerbaijani khanates'' which is a sufficient compromise on part of the editor. I'm not really understanding why you are trying to diminish or get rid of the fact that these khanates were Azerbaijani. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mTuscumbia: And deportations is the proper term to be used since those were state sponsored movements of ethnic Azerbaijanis and relocation of Persian and Ottoman Armenians in their places, planning initiated and/or assisted by ethnic Armenians Lazarev and Mikoyan. With your logic, should we also consider deportation of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey from Eastern Anatolia to Middle East as ''population movement''? You're taking it to another level with continuous edit-warring. If you keep doing it, you will be reported. Thank you. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mMagotteers: No, that's not a compromise. How can you call it that, when one side allow the existance of a duplicate article of Azeri and Turkic people of Armenia with a different name and besides its intro, it says nothing about the claimed subject it is supposed to discuss about. I can find more sources calling it a ''Persian Khanate'' (eg. 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. Sources also exist for ''Iranian Khanates'', including written by Turks, eg. 1, 2, etc. Besides, historically speaking the term ''Azerbaijan'' in that context had nothing to do with the current identity called ''Azerbaijani'' which is used as an ethnic identity rather than a qualifier of a geographic region within Iran. For that alone it should be sufficient to remove it on sight for any articles written for the general public since it requires a knowledge which generally they do not pocess.
Deportation is not a proper term, how is the ethnic clash of 1905-07 a deportation, there was no ''Armenian government'' then to start with, the claim of more than 200,000 Azeri being ''deported'' made by Van der Leeuw can't be backed by any statistical data (not to say that he is overtly an advocate of the Azeri cause), that's more than the entire recorded Azeri population of Armenia. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mTuscumbia: It ''is'' a compromise. Make an extra effort and type ''Azerbaijani khanates'' in google search and you'll come up with the Google Books results sufficient to determine that these khanates were Azerbaijani. The population was Azerbaijani Turks. They were independent and semi-independent depending on their agreements and treaties with Russian and Iran. The term deported is the correct term and I have already provided an explanation above. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH4: Repeated argument
[32mMagotteers: Checking a wording in google book to support what Ã  priori you support is sherry picking, comparaison is '''not''' (like the one I have done by searching different words). There are works which calls it Persian Khanates, Iranian Khanates. So leaving off any qualifier is the most sound thing to do. Also, ''Azerbaijani'' in the historic sense of the term has no ethnic meaning contrary to the modern definition of the word. It simply means that it was during the hight of the Iranian Empire, its Azerbaijan, derived from its province Azerbaijan. While it might sound relevant to use ''Azerbaijan'' or ''Azerbaijani'' for those initiated with the history of the region, that's not acceptable in a publication open to the public, a public who only know as ''Azerbaijani'' the modern identity of the Azeri Turks. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mKheo17: Magotteers, I put that "Azerbaijani khanates" term back in the article and tried to make more compromise on that sentence. I want you to inform that the source is from the Cambridge University Press. Moreover, the author of the work is an American-Polish professor and Caucasologist. I warn you last time! If you continue on removing my sourced content I will report you.. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mAnastasia.Bukh: Magoteers, you create disruption everywhere. He rudely dismisses all third party sources! Kheo, please report him! rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mMagotteers: That's a serious accusation you have here, an ''argumentum ad personam'' at its best. Unless you have anything concerning the article itself, don't add any more unfounded accusations against me. Kheo17, I did not remove it because it was unsourced, I removed it because it is sherry picking and that we can also add and source ''Persian'' and ''Iranian'' Khanate and that ''Azerbaijani'' in those sources have little or nothing to do with what we entend as ''Azerbaijani'' in the modern sense. There is a semantic change, a definition drift to the point that several authors need to add when treating the history of the region that the ''Azerbaijan'' they are refering to has not the same meaning as the modern term. Also, I'd like you to go further by actually reporting me and I will express how the article is basically a duplicate of an existing article which only difference is an intro and the title. Also to add, that you have included a map for instance, that the legend was removed and passed by you as something which original author did not intend. I was even reverted by you guys for simply clarifying that. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[31mTuscumbia: Why did you move the article to ''ideological concept''. This is not an ''ideological concept''. It is a ''political concept'' and this has already been discussed. Again, it is not a duplicate. This article is as much an article as Greater Armenia (political concept) article the text in which has been duplicated from other Armenia-related articles. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mKheo17: Magotteers, I did not put the map of the region after the Serves Treaty. However, the other three maps are mine. I find that map useless as well, so I am going to remove it from there. What concerns the khanates, you can find considerable number of sources arguing the existence of the Azerbaijani khanates in the modern Azerbaijani and Armenian territory. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mKheo17: I did not report anybody here yet, but somebody already reported me! rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMagotteers: A political concept may also be ideological, since it is beyond the scope of simply being political... I replaced it for ideological. The article is a duplicate... besides its intro, 100% is a duplicate from another article. As for Greater Armenia (political concept), if you have a problem with it, bring it there not here. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mMagotteers: Read what I wrote above again! rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mKheo17: Marshall Bagramyan, even Democratic Republic of Armenia's map was not recognized by the Allied Powers. Neither Wilsonian Armenia nor the Greater Armenia. It doesn't give you the right to remove the map of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mMarshallBagramyan: Armenia's western borders ''were'' properly delineated by the United States but the eastern borders had yet to be delineated. If we all accept this to be true, then we cannot present that map as if it presents borders which were internationally recognized. You are distorting the material and inserting point of view where none exists. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[33m78.86.151.248: Exactly, ADR was never recognised withing those borders. If ADR claimed those lands it does not mean that they belong to them. They did not have control over that territory so how can it be "split" from them, infact most of the time Armenian forces had control over those lands and more. But like Marshall mentioned there were no set borders between those new republics, so there is no way one can claim that something was split, taken away from them or whatever. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mTuscumbia: Oh yes, of course, Magotteers was blocked, now we have another sock jumping from article to article and mysteriously finding articles through google ) IP, ADR's borders including Zangezur were de-facto recognized in January 1920 in the Peace Conference while DRA borders were never recognized except for Wilsonian Armenia recognized by Wilson himself, which does not include the present day Armenia. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[35mMarshallBagramyan: Zangezur was a bastion of anti-Soviet resistance (under the command of Garegin Njdeh) by the Armenians during the summer of 1920. Even if Azerbaijan's ''de facto'' control of these borders was recognized, that does not mean that they were ''de jure'' recognized, which means that caption as well as the the map is inaccurate because this area should be shown as being disputed between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan never "lost" these territories because it never fully established control of these regions; it was hardly able to come to a compromise with the Armenians regarding Karabakh. Some of the sources for this article are still insufficient and very poor when it comes to reliability and we need maps produced by historians, not user-generated ones which pick and choose what to highlight and what do omit. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mMagotteers: Care to explain the name change? rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mTuscumbia: Yes, please see the discussion above, initially offered by MarshallBagramyan and agreed on by others. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMagotteers: A political concept is an ideological concept, if it is mostly used by Yeraz, it can't only be a political concept. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mTuscumbia: It's not only Yeraz who use it. It's been and is used throughout Azerbaijan and is a political concept as much as the term Greater Armenia. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mMagotteers: This further proves that it is not only a political concept. Neither is Greater Armenia only a political concept. Greater Armenia was a historical, geographical and is now an ideological concept. So there is no reason to add anything to ''Greater Armenia'', because the term is not alone what a clarification implies. On the other hand, the claim of Western Azerbaijan for the republic of Armenia is a modern Azeri construct which is ideological. While it is true that it is political, it is not only political, because ''political'' is only one type of ideology. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mTuscumbia: So was Azerbaijan. It is referred to as Western Azerbaijan because it was a part of Safavi, Ak Koyunlu, Kara Koyunlu states with Azerbaijani Turkic majority until a certain time in recent history. Ideology is something rather distancing from the realm, regardless whether the realm was the past, present or future. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mMagotteers: That's an interpretation, in the case of Armenia, there is no ''it is referred to because''..., there is no because or words to imply there is an interpretation. See the sources you find for Greater Armenia from google book when you restrict the date of the publications between 1700 and 1800, and then the results for between the years 1600 to 1700. ''Greater Armenia'' is a geographical, historical and an ideological concept. The fact that this modern ''Western Azerbaijan'' restricts to exactly the borders within Armenia is solely an ideological concept, it might be political, but political is also an ideology. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mMagotteers: BesÄ±des, if you have a problem with the article ''Greater Armenia'' bring Ä±t there, not here. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mTuscumbia: It's not an interpretation, it's a fact. The only reason Azerbaijani Turks did not use the term as much as today is because they never claimed the territories of their neighbors and because there was never an ideological concept of ''Greater Azerbaijan'', again because Azerbaijan never laid any claims to its neighbors. That's why you won't see as much in google books although I had already provided the google books results on this talk page. You can in circles over and over again but the article name has been discussed and compromised on already. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[35mMarshallBagramyan: Western Azerbaijan is a modern 20th century invention and it was never used as a geographical or historical term for the territories the Republic of Armenia is now located upon. This region was always called "Eastern Armenia" and labeled as such in maps and the Armenians only became a minority after Shah Abbas I's deportation of the Armenian population. The real western Azerbaijan can be said to be the western portion of the Iranian province south of the Araks River. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mMagotteers: That's a generalization, you are putting a racial characteristic here, be careful to not cross the border between simple characterization and racism. The google book result is irrelevant, since most of it refers to the Western portion of the republic of Azerbaijan. Also, we're not talking about compromise, you have offered no answer to counter my argument that the term ''Western Azerbaijan'' to refer to the modern republic of Armenia with clearly defined borders not extending in Georgia nor Turkey is only a political concept. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Repeated argument
[31mTuscumbia: Yes, it wasn't a historical term because there was no unified state '''called''' ''Azerbaijan'' or containing the word ''Azerbaijan'' in its name until 1918. But the region and population of the Azerbaijani states were Azerbaijani Turks. The term appeared in the 20th century to refer to a political concept. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mTuscumbia: Please save that ''racism'' nonsense for someone else. You make that kind of false accusations one more time, you will be reported again. Western Azerbaijan is a political concept. When you clearly define what you understand under ''political'' and ''ideological'' concepts, we can revisit the term. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mMagotteers: Your tone was unwaranted, I said be careful, not that you were. As for ideological vs political, read the intro of Ideology, you will see it includes ''political''. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mTuscumbia: I warned you. Now, I asked you to define not to direct to the article. When you define it in your own words, not as it is written in or may be interpreted from Ideology article, I'll be able to understand what it is that you really want. So, clarify what you understand under ''political'' and ''ideological'' concepts and the difference between them, and we will go from there. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
