[31mAlexikoua: Its clear that the present title is the most popular in literature compared to 'persecutions', especialy if we take into account the Pontian Genocide which is part of this article. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mTakabeg: The term "Genocide" is not used for all of these atrocities and massacres. Even some scholars use the term "Genocide" for all of only for all of them, it is not general trend. In short, Greek genocide is not common name of entire events. We'd better create the article Pontic Greek Genocide or Pontian Greek Genocide. I'm not sure but I felt Pontic Greek Genocide or Pontian Greek Genocide can be common name of events in Pontus. Otherwise, we cannot normalize and neutralize this article. UUnfortunately, at present, we must add {{NPOV}} to this article. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mAlexikoua: Takabeg, the fact that we should also have an article about the Pontic Genocide which is part of the Greek Genocide, is irrelevant with tagging this article as pov. Since this is the most used term in bibliography, as you proved (persecutions etc are less used), I wonder what's your argument on this. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mTakabeg: It's impossible. Maybe it's difficult for you to understand this problem with your {{systemic bias}}. But research on Google Books proved that this article cannot be kept under this title. As you know, the Greek ethnic cleansing in Chameria, massacre of Chams, Albanian massacres of the 1943-44 in Charmeria had taken place. If these persecutions, ethnic cleansing, massacres„ÄÄwas explained by combining with relatively smaller persecutions by Greece gov. and/or Greek people, under the title such as Albanian massacres by Greeks (instead of ‚Äúmassacres of Chams‚Äù), ‚ÄúAlbanian genocide" (instead of Albanian genocide in Chameria; somebody call ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù to these events), are these article neutral or not ? As you know, '''Pontic Genocide''' is not same as other massacres in Asia Minor. Apart from contents, this title abuses WP:COMMONNAME & WP:POVTITLE. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[31mAlexikoua: Actually you claim that 'Genocide' isn't widely established in literature, but your search in gbooks makes it the most popular term copared to 'Persecution' etc.. If you suggest another name or a split, feel free to make or explain your proposal. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mAli55te: How come Pontus is a small place ? It is the whole BLACKSEA REGION. There were more then 350.000 Greeks were living there before the genocide. Apart from there most of the remaining ones were in Costantinopole and Smyrna. Your hypothesis about this small region is not valid here. rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[36mGGT: I cannot understand how it can be understood that "genocide" is widely estanlished in reliable literature from those results and analysis. Is it just me seeing that there are about ten reliable sources calling this event "Greek genocide"? And is it just me who thinks that this is very few for the murder of a great number of people? Or is it me who does not know what a genocide is? I think an analysis of the "persecution" / "massacres" results would be helpful. And the NPOV tag should remain on the article until we settle this dispute with third party editors who has not yet commented on this issue, I think. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[35mKhirurg: No, I think this is just a case of WP:IJUSTDONTLIKEIT by Turkish editors, as with the Armenian Genocide. Because the only ones that complain about POV are Turkish editors. I have yet to see a "third party" editor come here and complain about the name, POV, etc... rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mTakabeg: I'm not a Turkish editor. But I understand that this article is not neutral. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[33mManocihr: Athenean is right, whole discussion is ludicrous. And Takabeg, you may not be a citizen of the Republic of Turkey, but it's clear from your username and edit history than you are a pan-Turkic nationalist of some kind - Azeri or what not. Not that such agenda-driven accounts - or even articles - are anything unusual in Wikipedia it seems... rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mTakabeg: Unfortunately, POVs of  and Manochihr are not neutral. Their approach are very biased. I think it's difficult to solve this issue for Greek and Turkish peoples. Of course, we can find some educated persons without systematic bias among both Greek and Turkish, but the number of them is very small.
Oh? And how am I biased exactly? Anyone who disagrees with you is biased? I'm not Greek, Turkish, or from a country anywhere ''even close'' to Anatolia or Europe. I'm not even from the same continent! I'm not religious, or ethno-nationalist. So pray, tell me, how is it that I am biased? rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[36mGGT: That is right, and I believe Takabeg's approach to this issue is neutral, at least more neutral than Athenean, who is a Greek editor, at least his/her username is related to Athens. I should add that Takabeg is often accused of being anti-Turkish, pro-Greek and pro-Kurdish by some Turkish users, see Talk:Zilan massacre for instance. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[33mManocihr: So Greek editors are biased and Turks aren't? Look, I have a degree in History, and I'm not ethnically or politically related to either side - and it's quite clear to me where the denial-of-history is coming from. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[36mGGT: No, I have not said that, I just said that Takabeg is not pro-Turkish, and according to some Turks he is pro-Greek. And I accept that I am ''naturally'' biased, I believe that a Turk or a Greek cannot be completely neutral when it comes to such issues. By the way, calling someone who disagrees with you as "denialist" is very annoying. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mAlexikoua: By the way I feel that Tag. needs to explain why "Pontic Genocide is not same as other massacres in Asia Minor", since it was geographically (Pontus is part of Asia Minor) and chronologically in the same context. rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[37m23x2: Hi, just wanted to share this with all of you. Ill paste a sample below for all those who could be bored to scroll through:
It is believed that in Turkey between 1913 and 1922, under the successive regimes of the Young Turks and of Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk), more than 3.5 million Armenian, Assyrian and Greek Christians were massacred in a state-organized and state-sponsored campaign of destruction and genocide, aiming at wiping out from the emerging Turkish Republic its native Christian populations. This Christian Holocaust is viewed as the precursor to the Jewish Holocaust in WWII. To this day, the Turkish government ostensibly denies having committed this genocide. Prof. Israel Charney, President of the IAGS
Turks admit that the Armenian persecution is the first step in a plan to get rid of Christians, and that Greeks would come next. ... Turkey henceforth is to be for Turks alone. Peter Balakian, The Burning Tigris, quoting the New York Times, September 14, 1915.
While the death toll in the trenches of Western Europe were close to 2 million by the summer of 1915, the extermination of innocent civilians in Turkey (the Armenians, but also Syrian and Assyrian Christians and large portions of the Greek population, especially the Greeks of Pontos, or Black Sea region) was reaching 1 million. Peter Balakian, The Burning Tigris, p. 285-286.
In an article for the August 1, 1926 edition of the Los Angeles Examiner, Mustafa Kemal (Atat√ºrk) also affirms the slaughters. Kemal writes:"those ... left-over from the former Young Turkish Party, ... should have been made to account for the lives of millions of our Christian subjects who were ruthlessly driven en masse, from their homes and massacred ..."
Mustafa Kemal ‚Äî Emile Hildebrand, "Kemal Promises More Hangings of Political Antagonists in Turkey," Los Angeles Examiner, August 1, 1926 (Sunday edition, Section VI).
If members of the United Nations pass appropriate legislation such incidents such as pogroms of Czarist Russian and the massacres of Armenians and Greeks by Turkey would be punishable as genocide. "Genocide Under the Law of Nations," New York Times, January 5, 1947.
Les pers√©cutions antihell√©niques poursuivies en Turquie depuis le d√©but de la guerre europ√©enne ne sont que la continuation du plan d'extermination de l'Hell√©nisme mis, depuis 1913, en pratique par les Jeunes-Turcs. Translation: "The anti-Greek persecutions carried out in Turkey since the beginning of the European War are but the continuation of the plan of extermination of Hellenism practiced by the Young Turks, since 1913." From the reports of diplomatic and consular officials.
... the Greeks of Anatolia are suffering the same or worse fate than did the Armenians in the massacres of the Great War. The deportation of the Greeks is not limited to the Black Sea Coast but is being carried out throughout the whole of the country governed by the Nationalists. Greek villages are deported entire, the few Turkish or Armenian inhabitants are forced to leave, and the villages are burned. The purpose is unquestionably to destroy all Greeks in that territory and to leave Turkey for the Turks. These deportations are, of course, accompanied by cruelties of every form just as was true in the case of the Armenian deportations five and six years ago. Stanley Hopkins, American employee of the Near East Relief, 16/11/1921. Regards rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[36mGGT: Well, I cannot find that quote in the works of Israel Charny, and there is no use of the term "Greek genocide" in the works by him. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[37m23x2: Well, if you can not find it in Google, it doesn't mean its not there. May i suggest looking into the actual Dr. Adam Jones book "Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction" as the reference was taken from there. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
