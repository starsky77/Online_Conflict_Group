{'text': 'That Chen had no genuine will to negotiate can be seen from the difference in approach between his administration and the current.

{'text': 'Enlighten me.  When did President Chen insist that the PRC publicly repudiate the one-China principle before talks could proceed?  President Chen merely said that Taiwan would not agree to it.  What pre-conditions did President Chen set for the talks?  The "existing basis for the talks" was a condition tht the PRC insisted on.  It was not something Taiwan insisted on nor was it something Taiwan insisted that the PRC disavow.\nIf you say "Taiwan was willing to talk without preconditions" misrepresents the truth, and in fact is a statement taken straight out of Chen-era propaganda.\', then tell me precisely what preconditions Taiwan wasn\'t willing to talk without.', 'username': 'Readin', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'Taiwan insisted on the condition that the basis of the talks should not be any version of the "one China principle" or "1992 Consensus". To describe the situation as "Taiwan was willing to talk without preconditions" is misleading, because it creates the impression that Taiwan made no demands. A more accurate phrasing might be "Taiwan insisted on negotiations without preconditions", and an even more accurate phrasing might be "Taiwan insisted that negotiations could not be on the basis of the 1992 consensus".\nIn one sense, the bigger problem is "willing". When you are insisting on changing the framework of negotiations, you are making demands on the modes of negotiations more than expressing a willingness to negotiate.\nWas it really "not something Taiwan insisted on nor was it something Taiwan insisted that the PRC disavow"?\nI don\'t think then-President Chen was so naive. He knew when he insisted that negotiations be "unconditional", that the mainland government could not agree to that due to domestic political pressure. If the mainland government was to accept his purported "invitation", it would amount to tacit endorsement of his repudiation of the 1992 consensus, and backtracking on its own stated and consistent position. Public opinion would not have swallowed it in China, and Chen knew this. My personal view remains that it was not a genuine proposal, but merely political posturing for domestic point-scoring.', 'username': 'PalaceGuard008', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
