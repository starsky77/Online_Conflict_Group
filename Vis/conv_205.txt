{'text': 'The lead (lede) paragraph of the aricle ends with the unreferenced statement:\nThe term neurobiology is often used interchangeably with the term neuroscience, although the former refers specifically to the biology of the nervous system.\nIt rests on the prior statement that neuroscience collaborates, in a way that is inferred as somehow unique, with other fields within science and elsewhere.  The statement:\nit is currently an interdisciplinary science\nwhich does not fit well with the wiki entry for the adjective interdisciplinary it is linked to\nInterdisciplinarity involves the combining of two or more academic disciplines into one activity (e.g., a research project). \'\'et seq\'\'\nWhile the silos of individual disciplines is often noted, it is hard to imagine a modern field of inquiry that holds itself apart from "collaboration".  Easier to accept would be a statement that neuroscience is pursued in certain establishments from the outset as a joint inquiry staffed by various disciplines that work co-operatively on projects.  If the claim is that it is an\ninterdiscipline or an interdisciplinary field, which is an organizational unit that crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines or schools of thought, as new needs and professions emerge.\nthen should be stated and references for the claim provided.  However the biggest issue for me in the last sentence of the lead paragraph is its inference of the omitted word "only".  Biology is a vast area of enquiry.  In its most elementary sense being simply the study of life.  Innate to it is the study of biological functioning, and within this its centrality to medical science.  Mollecular biology embraces chemistry and the origin of life concerns the physics of our inert planet.  Functioning in respect of neurological inquiry concerns itself with messaging processes, transmission and receipt mechanisms and their agents of operation - chemical and physical.  IMO the sentence should simply be deleted and the lead paragraph altered to set neuroscience out as a monicker for collaborative interdisciplinary projects, with neurobiology as its natural (as opposed to artificial) academic home.

{'text': 'Let\'s be objective: neuroscience is a branch of biology, which is based on mathematics and deals with the physical and chemical properties of living organisms. Saying that neuroscience "also draws upon fields including mathematics and physics" is redundant and obvious just like it would be for physiology or molecular biology. Medicine is an application of biology. Writing that neuroscience draws upon medicine would like writing that electromagnetism draws upon engineering. I think that if we want, we could write that neuroscience collaborates with fields like psychology and cognitive science, but if you write that neuroscience investigates the basis of processes like cognition or behaviour it also becomes redundant.', 'username': 'Darwinsbulldog', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}

As to your statements and concerns:\nneuroscience is a branch of biology, which is based on mathematics and deals with the physical and chemical properties of living organisms.  This is a rather idiosyncratic definition of biooogy. In any event, it has been well-established by reliable sources that neuroscience is a multidisciplinary science. Please take a gander at the sources in the lead and talk page. In fact, take a look at the table of various multidisciplinary fields.\nThe lead doesn\'t say physics and mathematics anymore.\nMedicine is not just an "application of biology." It\'s a separate discipline in its own right. That analogy of electromagnetism doesn\'t hold.\nSerious question. Is cognitive science not a subfield of psychology? Or has it truly splintered off? On a separate issue, neuroscience doesn\'t just collaborate with these fields. It actually incorporates or "draws" upon them.\nI agree that the lead could be improved.

{'text': 'Neuroscience is not the only discipline that collaborates with computer science so Darwinsbulldog\'s edit was wrong, also if the redundancy is not obvious it could be useful. Anyway, engineering too is a discipline in it\'s own right but it is based on physics and you don\'t write on the physics page that it "draws upon" engineering. Modern medicine is an applied science based on biology (unless you consider pseudosciences like "homeopathy" or "naturopathy" as medicine...) so I don\'t think that we should write on the first paragraph of the article that neuroscience draws upon medicine. Of course one of neuroscience\'s application is in neurology but I think that on the first part of the article we should explain what neuroscience is and not focus on listing all the other disciplines neuroscience collaborates with. I think that the former edit: \'\'\'It is a multidisciplinary branch of biology, that deals with the anatomy, biochemistry, molecular biology, and physiology of neurons and neural circuits as well as their relationship with emergent functions such as behavior, cognition and learning\'\'\' gave a better idea of what neuroscience is in the first place (as written in the Society For Neuroscience\'s definition) https://www.sfn.org/about/about-neuroscience', 'username': 'Sincosx', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
{'text': 'The SfN page does not provide a simple definition of neuroscience. It briefly describes the function of the brain, its importance, and the motivation of neuroscientists. For example, it states that "Brain researchers are motivated to understand behavior." That\'s very different from saying "....neural circuits as well as their relationship with emergent functions such as behavior, cognition and learning." Such a statement would require a source (WP:RS) that explicitly states that. In any event, it doesn\'t have to come at the expense of describing the multidisciplinary nature of the field. This IS important. Neuroscientists with a psychology background will study the brain very differently from neuroscientists with a biological or computational background. Hence, there are big differences between behavioral neuroscience and neuroethology, for example. As for the statement that medicine is nothing more than an applied science based on biology, that is just simplistic and does not consider how the various fields are actually organized. For instance, it may seem on the surface that people who study the behavioral and biological aspects of human beings are biologists, but they are actually biological anthropologists. This type of arbitrary convention also applies to the organization of biology and medicine as separate disciplines. I don\'t doubt there is overlap, but to say one just "applies" the knowledge that was developed from the other is simply not true. WP\'s medicine page does an excellent job of explaining the field. Anyway, other editors should weigh in. Hopefully there will be consensus on a stable version for the lead.', 'username': 'Danielkueh', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
