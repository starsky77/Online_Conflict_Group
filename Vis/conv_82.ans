[31mCollect: Clear POV fork which actually is full of copyvios from Mayer et al. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mRd232: Fork of... what? Much of the content is rejected for inclusion at Koch Family Foundations, and there is (AFAIK) no existing page which summarises the family's political activities. The text is largely copied from existing pages or old versions of Koch Family Foundations, so any copyvios (such as?) have been transferred thusly. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mMBMadmirer: I am curious if there are any analogous pages? People like George Soros and Peter Lewis on the left have comparable engagement in US politics. Richard Mellon Scaife has been compared to Koch. The only comparable page I can find is George Soros conspiracy theories. Thoughts? rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mCollect: (ec) Clear copyvio of Mayer. Material ''already'' in Koch Industries, David Koch, Charles Koch, Fred Koch, Koch family, Americans for Prosperity, Koch Family Foundations, Politics of global warming (United States), Tea Party movement, and Richard Fink. Seems more than enough places on WP for the opinions of Mayer, no? 10 articles all with her opinion that the Kochs are evil incarnate. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mArthur Rubin: Rename to "Mayer's view of the Koch family"?  I don't see it as copyvios, but just WP:NPOV and WP:UNDUE violations.  (And, if deleted, the material added here should '''not''' be returned to the articles it was copied from without due consideration of WP:BLP, WP:NPOV, and relevance.)  â€” rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mRd232: I don't know, are there analogous ''cases''? You cite individuals, whose activities are obviously handled in their own bios (eg George_Soros#Political_donations_and_activism), though they may be spun off WP:SUMMARY-style in the usual way if necessary. By contrast, the way in which the activities of the different members of the Koch family overlap, as individuals and via their company and via their foundations, makes a single page to bring these together (as some sources do) a different proposition than discussion of each of those separately in their own entries. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mRd232: Obviously the article needs expansion - WP:IMPERFECT; but it's not like it's based on a single source. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mArthur Rubin: The article needs contraction, removing "information" and sources which clearly violate WP:BLP.  I removed 2 of the references to Mayer's interview as being clearly ''her'' opinion, but Rich's article is an Op-Ed, which is not reliable for questions of fact, only (at best) of notability.  I haven't gone through the rest of the references for credibility.  â€” rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mRd232: Well, those same issues are strewn across various related articles; that's inevitable when the subject of the article touches on so many things! Bringing them all together in one place allows all this material to be considered in the appropriate wider perspective, and improved, and the resulting improvements later carried over to related articles. It would be ''easier'' not to bother, and just leave everything to simmer quietly, but this will ultimately produce higher quality. The different context, for instance, can encourage a more scholarly and less personalistic approach, focussing on facts and their significance. Mayer may have brought this to public attention, but there are certainly other sources. It needs a lot of work, though. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mMBMadmirer: I don't know about that. For example Soros Fund Management (the company) gave money to 527s, their PAC gave money to candidates, the various foundations associated with him give money to things. Because these are two brothers, it is a whole different category? That seems like a stretch. If anything the closest analogy is the George Soros conspiracy theories where crazy people over-project for political reasons onto people. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mRd232: I don't really know what you're getting at, but I have no objection in principle to Political activities of George Soros, if that helps any. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mCollect: 10 articles on Soros?  I doubt it.  The same stuff is being peddled in 10 articles here - and it is all opinion in any case. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mRd232: it is all opinion in any case - I'm going to nominate Charles Koch co-founding the Cato Institute (sourced to Cato) as my black swan. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mArthur Rubin: Well, we should have a third party source.... â€” rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mRd232: For that? Not really. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
