[31mPi.1415926535: Oakland Coliseum station rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mPi.1415926535: I would appreciate some uninvolved eyes on Oakland Coliseum station.  has added what I feel is an excessive level of detail about connecting bus routes, and continually reverts me when I remove it. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mSounderBruce: The table of bus routes is pretty unnecessary. The best way to convey bus information is to list operators and the general destination of routes in prose, followed by a list of route numbers if necessary. This is the method I've been using for my light rail GAs and lone FA (Tukwila International Boulevard station) and it's worked well. '''''' rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mTitanosaurus: I have started another discussion on the WikiProject Buses talk page. '''O''' rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mTitanosaurus: I think that aesthetically speaking at least, it is much more easier to locate and understand the bus connection information using the table format as seen on good article Coney Islandâ€“Stillwell Avenue or even the list format that Pi.1415926535 wants to use than using the written format as seen in your article where the bus connection information is somewhat "buried" in there. I would also like to note that the station you linked doesn't even see a quarter of the bus service Oakland Coliseum does, is in a higher-income/lower-density area than Oakland Coliseum that is less transit dependent, and doesn't seem to attract as much bus ridership as Oakland Coliseum does (If I am wrong about the ridership please feel free to correct me with sourced information). '''O''' rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[34mTitanosaurus: I think that this would be better discussed with WikiProject Buses, as I have created the bus table on the grounds of AC Transit officially establishing Oakland Coliseum station as one of its transit centers. An important bus station/transit center serving routes that carry over 2.5 million passengers a year (the rail services at the station see about 2.6 million passengers a year in comparison) combined between the station and its surrounding high-density/low-income neighborhoods at that.

[36mMorphenniel: The detailed information on bus routes and connections violates WP:NOT.  Wikipedia is NOT a travel guide, and the fact is that this information is exactly that. I have deleted it.  Any attempt to re-add this information needs to state how it is "encyclopedic".  At best it can be re-added with substantial editing to remove superfluous details that are making it a travel guide at the moment. - rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mTitanosaurus: Can you explain your rationale in detail before you remove what I consider to be a major and informative part of the page that has information seen on many other pages like I just did above even though it seemed to miss you? I would also appreciate it if you linked appropriate and relevant sources to back up your claim. You linked to WP:NOT, except that is a loose arbitrary guideline that doesn't really go into detail about this specific situation, why shouldn't a bus station that is designated as such by several local public transit agencies (as I proved through a source above that you might have overlooked) not have information on the routes that go there? Giving detailed information about a specific place/topic is exactly what an encyclopedia is supposed to do, and what the page currently does. It is also not helpful or informative to simply state that it needs "substantial" editing without going into detail about what specific "editing" it actually needs to have it meet your rather arbitrarily and loosely enforced "encyclopedic" standards. Please do not remove my heavily researched and relevant content without seriously discussing it with me first (WP:DINC, WP:BRD, WP:DRDSTNC, WP:EANOTWC, WP:ETP, WP:DDH), I need to know what the guideline for situations like this is going forward so I can continue to make appropriate and helpful edits to the website in the future. Several other train stations that have a significant public transportation presence (which I yet also linked to above), particularly those in the New York City area, have the same information I put on there, yet everyone seems to be fine with that, so why is this unclear policy being so strictly enforced on Oakland Coliseum all of the sudden? Yes, WP:ATAIDD might lead you to believe that my argument isn't admissible, but that same article says my argument has more credibility to it than your typical "What about article x?" argument as I have referred to and linked to a couple of articles which were deemed Good Articles by several editors, including some who belong to this very WikiProject. If you're not interested in seriously discussing this, leave the page alone, and I will bring the issue up with the Reference Desk or another resource.

[35mMjroots: {{ping|Titanosaurus}] you mentioned WP:BRD. It is exactly that - bold, revert, discuss. It's not WP:BRRD, WP:BRRRD or even WP:BR(âˆž)D. You boldly added the info, it was reverted. Next step is to discuss on talk page (or here). rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mMorphenniel: Wikipedia is very clear on this issue.  We are not a travel guide. Information of that nature can be found on the webpage of the transit agency.  All you are doing is repeating/replicating/duplicating that info on this page.  It will be deleted.  Now that you have prompted, I shall do the same to other articles that you have added this nonsense to. San Rafael Transit Center looks like a good candidate. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[36mMorphenniel: WP:BRD allows you a single revert, and then you need to discuss on the talk page and establish consensus. You have now revert twice today  and .  Also you have via en edit summary of this diff  admitted to WP:OWN.  To quote you " ... leave this page alone."  You are on a slippery slope towards being blocked. - rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
