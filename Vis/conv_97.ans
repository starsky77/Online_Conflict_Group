[31mSirtaptap: There remains nothing constructive about the Criticism section, it just reads like complaints from angry users, not anything from critics of note, research ect. What value does it pose and how can it be cleaned up? rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mSirtaptap: Upon further inspection, the Criticism section is almost the sole work of one author (apparently with a chip on his shoulder) and I've removed the most irrelevant bits. If reddit (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit) doesn't have a Criticism section I fail to see why Stack Exchange Network should have one. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mRenesis: I've blanked the whole section.  The only sources for criticism whatsoever were two blog articles.  Blogs are self-published sources and as such are not notable ("Anyone can create a personal web page or pay to have a book published, and then claim to be an expert in a certain field.") with very few exceptions (such as an established expert in the relevant field who has been published by ''reliable'' third-parties).  I oppose any readdition of criticism until a reliable source is established that shows the criticism under discussion is owed due weight. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mSirtaptap: Perfectly acceptable. The non-blog posts were just questions from the site's feedback forum; angry user comments belong on the feedback forum, not on Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not a vector to air grievances. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mSirtaptap: The general description of the site is perfectly acceptable for a basic article. Your personal grievances with the site are not. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mSirtaptap: You're the only one that's written the section. It's clearly a pet project of yours. All of the "sources" are angry user feedback. Angry user emails/support calls/ect would not be considered notable for other resources. Do you think I could cite a wikipedia talk page rant in a Criticism section on the page on Wikipedia? It's absurd. And Critcism sections appear to be quite rare (and short, if they exist) for similar web sites. Even 4chan doesn't have a criticism section, nor does reddit, Slashdot, Qoura ect. Wikipedia is not a place for rants. Express your grievances to Stack Exchange Network directly not by making it's Wikipedia article a laundry list of your personal problems with it. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[34mManishearth: I am going to rewrite the section myself. Or let someone else rewrite it, but currently it is against WP:UNDUE, [[WP:NEUTRAL, and WP:RELY. SE did _not_ set this up, I noticed this section and took action as an editor of Wikipedia (not in my capacity as Chem.SE moderator). I ''do agree'' that my rewriting ''may be against WP:NEUTRAL as well'', I plan to put it up for review later (I also shall ask at WP:VPP for clarification on this). Profile deletion only happens if you follow the instructions under "contact us" (there's a form for account deletion somewhere there). Re: connecting the two: your reply seems to just confirm that the two are connected.  Re: Criticism of Wikipedia: Again, read WP:UNDUE. There are ''lots'' of pages on Wikipedia, a large Criticism page isn't undue weight. On the other hand, there are very few pages about SE on Wikipedia. The current Criticism section takes up half of the page on the network, that is clearly a lot of undue weight. Due to WP:3RR, I'm not reverting your revert (though you've already broken 3RR in the past, looking at the history of this article). Re:privacy policy: Yes, Wikipedia safeguards it, your IP address and email aren't visible to mewhich is what the privacy policy states. Wikipedia neither cares about nor controls one user looking up the other via publicly available resources. Re:blog sources: You are citing ''comments'' on blogs in multiple places.  â€¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mManishearth: I am removing this section, there have been enough arguments for that above. The entire section has been written by a single "disgruntled user". find the SE user g24lthe current profile says:
A lot of the criticism there is founded, but a lot of it is referencing comments on blog posts. Also, the size of it goes against WP:UNDUE. It would be better if someone who is not at odds with the network wrote this section (I may do so when I get time).

[34mManishearth: Re:todelete No, that's outdated. There's a form for it now, at . At no point in time did just placing "todelete" get it deleted. You had to notify the higher ups somehow, IIRC. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mManishearth: Re: "Only content is to be judged here"  We need to ensure that the article is written from a neutral point of view. A disgruntled user writing a criticism article seems like a rant (I do agree that blanking it was not the best course of action given my affiliation). So, Wikipedia's policies (specifically WP:NPOV), do involve making conclusions based on the knowledge of a user's identity. I am _not_ calling you that disgruntled user, I just mentioned that you two _may_ be the sameit certainly looks that way to me. If you are not, I humbly apologize. I am _not_ removing the links however (unless Bjelleklang feels it necessary). rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument

[36m80.218.174.215: You are linking to superuser.com for a profile that is on SE. Something is not right , and you should pay more attention to details. Moreover, You are not NPOV since you have admitted to be an avid user of  SE . I have not which makes me more NPOV than you. You cannot prove that i am a disgruntled user in any way. Thus you can only judge from content. finaly, linking to content of people that cannot be verifiably connected to my profile is only being done to intimidate me from maintaining this page. I will not tolerate such behaviour. Whatever way it looks to you, I do not care but I accept your apology. You should work constructively, if you are interested in this article to enhance the sections that may need to grow, instead of removing what you do not like due to your likeness to SE . That would be welcome. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
