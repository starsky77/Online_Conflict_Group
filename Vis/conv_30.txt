{'text': "No, but why does that matter? Apple has left the 3D touch app switcher ability in for 3 betas since 11.1 Beta 2. That's a pretty big sign that they AREN'T going to remove it. So I think I'm allowed to write that it was re-added in Beta 2. That's all there is to it. You can't keep reverting everybody's edits just because it doesn't flow well with you dude, that's called edit warring. Anyways, back to the question, I do think beta 5 is the final beta, and that's because I've been using the iOS betas for a while now, and I've studied how Apple releases their betas. It's usually a 4-5 beta cycle with minor updates (11.x, not 11.x.x) and a smaller beta cycle with smaller updates (11.x.x), and a larger cycle with major iOS updates. (Example being iOS 11 had 10 betas before it was released to the public, and iOS 10 had 8 or so) -   ·", 'username': 'KamranMackey', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH7: Refuting the central point'], 'coordination_labels': []}
