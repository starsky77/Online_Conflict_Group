[31mSionk: Completely agree, recentism, consistency and verifiability wins the day. I put Edmond Safra back because he died in 1999, but that is 15 years ago so I would understand if someone else thought that it was inappropriate. At least it is easy to tell that someone who had $2.5 billion in 1999 was mega rich. I'd be unable to easily make that comparison for someone who died in 1965, like Corm. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mBcd3174: GOODKARMA @Bonadea and Sionk. As I messaged you both, can we please bury the hatchet. We are NOT enemies and I harbor no other intention than making this list as ACCURATE as possible (just like you)! That means that I apologize for past coarse language. It was only a reaction to having all my hard work deleted under really lame arguments (with all due respect). And you should appreciate the (educated) work I put into this page. I happen to know Lebanese wealth inside out. It doesn't work according to Forbes lists or other BS lists that are known to be notoriously incomplete (when not downright WRONG). There are AT LEAST 5 Lebanese billionaires living in Africa that are not included in Forbes and co. nor the list I compiled. Why? Because these guys' fortune, well above 1 billion USD, is unknown. It could be 1, it could be 10. Their assets are "undercover". Also, and contrary to you Anglo-Saxon thinking, it is common practice in the Middle East to talk about FAMILIES. Forbes MENA (the regional version of Forbes) recently released its list of "RICHEST" and it was a list of... MENA's RICHEST FAMILIES!!! That's the way it works around here: FAMILY WEALTH! Because nobody, including Forbes (!) and hence I trust you will agree neither of you too, can or will ever be able to breakdown the wealth of individual family members. Again, this is how it works around here and if even FORBES approaches the "issue" that way, I trust that you guys will have the humbleness to respect that approach too. Getting to Corm, he was the exclusive agent of Ford Motor Cars for the entire Middle East. Everybody in Lebanon knows the Corms are worth billions. But they are a discreet family who have no interest in being in Forbes (which in turn has no way of measuring their fortune hence does not list them). Now either you want to make this page ACCURATE AND FAIR, either you want to just propagate s* intelligence and information, creating a snowball effect that just reinforces Forbes and co. s* lists. Also Bonadea and with all due respect, your date of death logic is BS! Either you consider a man dead and hence don't include him or his family in the list either you do (again, please read above my part on FAMILY WEALTH). But I don't think it is your prerogative to decide what length of death is acceptable or not! If you insist in removing Corm, then you MUST remove Safra and Hayek. If you don't, you have no consistency. And consistency is the key to credibility. And credibility is EXACTLY what Wikipedia lacks. So if your plan is to KILL Wikipedia (whose death I am convinced is around the corner as nobody I know trusts a word coming from Wikipedia, they just use it as a quick info "fix" on subjects of little importance to them), continue applying DOUBLE STANDARDS the way you do. I just HATE double standards. They are just about the biggest impediments to OBJECTIVE reporting.

[31mSionk: It would be easier to remove all the dead people, I agree. The redlinked people should probably be removed too, unless there is some proof they exist, are Lebanese and are mega wealthy - WP:LISTPEOPLE applies here. Information needs to be verifiable with no original research, or anyone could make anything up and nobody would be any the wiser. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mBcd3174: GOODKARMA Dear Sionk (and Bonadea)! SO glad to be COLLABORATING with you instead of debating with you! Removing the dead people is an option but it would leave out 3 famously rich Lebanese: Hayek, Corm and Safra! Nobody will take this list seriously without them! Trust me. It's like having a list of "tech gurus" and not seeing Jobs because he's dead! Unthinkable. As to the redlinked, we all know that that only means that they are not on Wikipedia and is in no way a "stamp of approval/disproval"! Taha Mikati is redlinked although he is one of the most famous Middle East billionaires. He just doesn't have a Wikiepedia entry. His brother, Najib, does. Does it make sense to "ban" him?! I doubt so. The same goes for Haddad and co... Maya Papaya should be removed! I have yet to find ANY proof of her existence... So what do you think guys (girls?!)? I would say keep the dead Hayek, Corm and Safra. As to the redlinked, I believe Taha Mikati and Carlos Haddad definitely have to be in the list. All the other entries apart from those 5 who are either dead of redlinked should probably be removed. Just my humble thoughts. What do my partners (you) think? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument

[31mSionk: Until you accept that Wikipedia needs information to be verifiable, we're not going to get anywhere. The most urgent tasks are (1) to write articles/find sources about the redlinked billionaires (assuming they are "famous") and (2) to find reliable proof of their wealth. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument

[32mBcd3174: GOODKARMA Sionk. I am not adding him BECAUSE he is my grandfather but because that is the TRUTH. Should I apologize for having a rich grandfather?! I can't believe I wrote you all those kind messages hoping we could finally work hand in hand and here you go again and just revert all my input with, as the only reply to my messages, a blunt one liner and a concealed threat?!  â€”Â Preceding unsigned comment added by   â€¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mBonadea: Redlinks are not a problem as such as long as there are sources for the people involved - of course, just as you say, if there are no sources they can't be included. I think, as we have already discussed, that a logical first step would be to remove all the people who are deceased, because including people who are not actual living rich individuals makes very little sense, and as mentioned before, it makes this list different from all the others (which also makes no sense). At the moment, that would mean removing Hayek, Safra and (yet again) Corm. '''' rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mBcd3174: Bcd3174 I will dispute any additions to the list as I just edited it unless you come up with proof of the previous 5 billionaires listed. I even took off my grandfather (to Sionk's and Bonadea's satisfaction). On Wikipedia, the burden on the proof lies on the person ADDING information. I am here to make sure that that burden lies on those it is suppose to. Over and out...  â€”Â Preceding unsigned comment added by   â€¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument

[32mBcd3174: Bcd3174 This page is now and finally in accordance with several leading sources on Lebanese wealth. All entries are supported by reliable sources and the people in the list are all household names in Lebanon. We will never reach PERFECTION. This is probably as good a list as it gets. Please do not change it. Thanks.  â€”Â Preceding unsigned comment added by   â€¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mBonadea: This source (mentioned above on this page) has been removed again, together with two entries supported by it. It does not appear to meet the requirements for a reliable source; the good people over at the reliable sources noticeboard might have more input on this, however. Since there is no consensus to include people who are deceased, Charles Corm (who died in 1963) cannot be included here.  '''' rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument

[31mSionk: Tried unsuccessfully to find a mention online of the Middle East Wealth Study 2014, which is the alleged source of the MENAopportunities list. However, I found a Middle East Wealth Study 2013 by Camden Wealth/QFC (Qatar Financial Center?). This describes people and families only in general terms, no specific wealth list. I'll be curious to know who published the 2014 study, and where. rebuttal_labels::
