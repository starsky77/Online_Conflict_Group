[31mTerrorist96: Re:  The logos were considered to resemble pedophile logos is based on the FBI leaked document. Why do you oppose including that fact in order to explain the connection? It's mentioned in the NYT source. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mTerrorist96: How is it a false narrative? It's stated in the NYT article. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mEggishorn: What VM said.  The ''Inquisitr'' reference you tried to add has been rejected as far too credulous earlier, and the "leaked FBI document" has never been authenticated.  The NYT article uses multiple qualifiers, which were left out. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mTerrorist96: Thanks for explaining. Can you link me to the discussion that determined the inquisitor article should be excluded? I searched and didn't find consensus to not use that article (mostly about aceloewgold.com, whatever that is). And this is all I found searching WP:RSN about using it as an RS. And there are other sources that connect the Satanic ritual claim with the mention of "spirit cooking" in the leaked emails; see: Snopes. This isn't to claim that the spirit cooking is actually Satanic, but that that was why the connection was made. And if we're mentioning the theories, we should state the reason behind the theory. This is already done for the handkerchief code theory (explaining that it arose based on the email saying: "The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related."
Re: FBI document: We can put "unverified" prior to "F.B.I. document" if you like. However, again, the point is not whether it's been authenticated or not, but the fact the theory of the logos being connected to pedophile logos arose based on the FBI document. And I never got an explanation for "false narrative"; I was just explaining the reason behind the theories. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mNorthBySouthBaranof: 'The Inquisitr'' is not a reliable source, and moreover, the claim that they are "similar" is entirely-unsourced anonymous pareidolia; the phrasing you are choosing implies that somehow the purported "leaked FBI document" supports the idea that these purported similarities are in any way meaningful, which it does not. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mTerrorist96: You say Inquisitor isn't a reliable source, but you didn't provide a link to that consensus. The article already uses the word "similarities" for the Satanic and pedophilic symbols(''Theorists linked the conspiracy to Comet Ping Pong, through similarities between company logos and symbols related to Satanism and pedophilia.''). So should that be removed? Fair enough on the phrasing, can you help rephrase it? How about: ''"based on purported similarity to an unauthenticated leaked FBI document."'' Do you deny that the FBI documents were the reason the connection was made though? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH5: Counterargument

[33mObjective3000: The first sign that this is a terrible article is  The author of the article mostly writes about professional wrestling. Seriously, this is not close to a reliable source. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mTerrorist96: That's just a reported fact. At one point people did have theories of Julian Assange being assassinated because he hadn't made a public appearance for some time. Regardless, I'm not trying to add that to the article and the Snopes link also mentions spirit cooking. I just find it odd that the article mentions satanic ritual theories but doesn't explain the genesis of those theories being linked to the mention of spirit cooking in the leaked emails. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mTerrorist96: That's cuz it's mentioned in the NYT article: link. The Inquisitor link was for mentioning spirit cooking. rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mSlatersteven: Err the NYT article does not say the FBI found  the logos were similar to Pedophile ones, rather it says that third parties said the FBI listed logos looked like those from the pizza place. The FBI document did not make the comparison. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mTerrorist96: I never claimed that the FBI made the comparison. I simply said that the theorists came to their conclusion that the company logos were pedophilic based on the FBI document that purports to show "Symbols and Logos Used by Pedophiles to Identify Sexual Preferences". rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[35mSlatersteven: Sorry but I cannot find where you say anything more then the rather misleading "based upon an leaked FBI document". This maybe whyt it's inclusion is being opposed. Now if you wanted to say "non professional investigators took logos linked to pedophiles and claimed they looked like the ones used by..." that might just pass muster. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mTerrorist96: Yeah, the claim that the logos are similar to pedophile logos is based upon the FBI document. I offered a revised version: ''based on purported similarity to an unauthenticated leaked FBI document'' above. Would you continue to object to this wording as well? There's nothing here saying that the FBI made the comparison. The comparison was made by the theorists. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[35mSlatersteven: Which is why the fact it is an FBI document is irrelevant. They could just have easily used a copy of the Beno or an episode of Black Adder. The fact that the document was produce by the FBI does not give the theorists analysis of it any validity. Hell even the document it's self is unverified. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mTerrorist96: So are we supposed to ignore the source just because it's a purported FBI document? I'm not trying to provide validity to the claims, just explain their genesis. When the article says the logos were claimed to look similar to pedophile logos, a reader may wonder what that claim is based on. What are pedophile logos? Why did they think the logos looked like pedophile logos? The NYT article mentions this, I don't see why we should omit it. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[35mSlatersteven: The reader has a link they can go to, that explains it more fully then we can. This is what the text would have to say rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mSlatersteven: On line investigators (with no connection to enforcement) looked at an alleged FBI document and concluded that the logos the document claimed were logos used by pedophiles as a kind of secret system of recognition looked similar to corporate logos used by some of the stores alleged to be part of pizzagate. It has been pointed out that many organisations use similar logos, and that no law enforcement agency (including the FBI) had made such a link. rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mSlatersteven: So do we agree to this wording?. rebuttal_labels::
