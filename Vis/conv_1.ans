[31mLahiruG: State terrorism rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mLahiruG: I have removed a part of the recently added section on State Terrorism (given below) from the article, because there is no need to elaborate on State Terrorism in Sri Lanka here, as there is a separate page named Sri Lanka and state terrorism in Wikipedia to cover the topic. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mLahiruG: The Sri Lankan government and the Sri Lankan Armed Forces have been charged with massacres, indiscriminate shelling and bombing, extrajudicial killings, rape, torture, disappearance, arbitrary detention, forced displacement and economic blockade. According to Amnesty International state terror was institutionalized into Sri Lanka's laws, government and society. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mObi2canibe: There are numerous articles which deal with LTTE & JVP terrorism (e.g. Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam; List of attacks attributed to the LTTE; List of attacks attributed to the LTTE, 1970s; List of attacks attributed to the LTTE, 1980s; List of attacks attributed to the LTTE, 1990s; List of attacks attributed to the LTTE, 2000s; List of people assassinated by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam; Suicide bombings in Sri Lanka; Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna; 1971 JVP Insurrection; 1987â€“89 JVP Insurrection; List of people assassinated by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna; List of assassinations of the Second JVP Insurrection; etc). So why don't you summarise their terrorism into one sentence on this article? It seems you are applying double standards here - one for terrorism which you support (Sri Lankan state terrorism) and another for which you don't (LTTE terrorism and JVP terrorism). rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[31mLahiruG: Please use the page Sri Lanka and state terrorism to elaborate on state terrorism, rather than do it here. If you continue to violate NPOV policy I will report you at the Wikipedia:ANI. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mObi2canibe: I'm afraid it is you who is in violation of WP:NPOV because of your vehement opposition to including even a two sentence paragraph on terrorism you approve of (state terrorism) but you are more than happy to repeat extensive content from other articles (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, 1987â€“89 JVP Insurrection, Prevention of Terrorism Act (Sri Lanka)) on terrorism you disapprove of. So please go ahead with your threat to report me to ANI. We'll see if you are man enough to follow up your threats or if you're a typical WP:BULLY - all talk and no show. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH0: Name calling/hostility, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mLahiruG: First of all, I should tell you that I am just a neutral Sri Lankan wikipedian, like many others, who do not accept any kind of terrorism (whether it is state or non-state). But it seems like there are certain wikipedians who accept terrorism of specific groups they love, admire and sympathize. It is not me who is vehemently trying delete and remove pages/content which exposes the crimes of terrorist groups here. Due to POV editing, presently the coverage of Sri Lankan war related articles are very unbalanced and what I am trying to do here is to balance the things. If you can point out the policies or guidelines you follow to add state terrorism in to this page,I can follow it and balance the things with NPOV editing by elaborating on '''terrorism in Sri Lanka''' in the page Sri Lanka and state terrorism. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Stating your stance
[31mLahiruG: I am not the bully who reverts the edits of all the new Sri Lankan wikipedians due to the fear of their  potential threat to challenge your POV editing. You fear the newbies and revert even their good edits to discourage them and I have evidence. I just gave you a warning and if you continue with your unacceptable bullish behaviour I will definitely report you, when the correct time arrives. Don't forget that Wikipedians who has done hundred thousands of contributions also get blocked if they do not adhere to the policies in Wikipedia. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
