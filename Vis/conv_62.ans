[32mFroggerlaura: The consensus seems to be that there are no structural differences in the hoof wall keratins between white and dark hooves. One of the more recent studies found no difference in shoeing horses with white hooves . Another conformation article  references older studies that came to the same conclusion. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31m71.181.48.72: Interesting.  Wonder how many horses in the study had both light and dark feet, noting that the one case had different results; that is definitely my own observation, that a horse with both light and dark feet has differences (usually slightly softer white feet) between them. The adage that white feet are inherently inferior is not the point anyone is making here, but wonder about validity of these studies, saw one indicating that white hooves absorbed more moisture, though black hooves could absorb quite a bit also.  That 2004 one says "22 shod hooves were obtained for testing" - sounds like cadaver hooves - do you have the full article, were they live horses tested?  I suppose we could downplay the white hooves thing here if it ends the drama, but it was an issue raised, so I don't know if that's best. I think it's overkill to view the issue as completely debunked or as a "superstition" as there clearly needs to be more research done. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mMontanabw: No.  That article is in a blog that cites a study done in 1986, it is insufficient for WP:RS.  Also, phrases such as "superstition" are unencyclopedic.  White hooves ARE a bit softer, anyone who has ever seen a hoof trimming can tell you that.  This does not mean that they are "inferior," just that they may have different issues, particularly for horses kept in stalls most of the time, as is done with race horses. If there is a better study, feel free to post it here, and we can take another look at it. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36m216.227.122.184: ask anyone who has seen a hoof trimming and"my own observation" are not scientific resources. The article you cite only gives a farrier's statement, not a scientific study. I have a horse with 3 black hooves and a white one, guess which one is the problem? Not the white one... rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36m216.227.122.184: Please find me a study that shows that white hooves are inferior, because from what I've seen all the studies except "your experience" show that they are equal, so your statements are 100% unscientific. There are reasons we use science and not superstition in modern society. Just because you were wearing those particular underwear every time your team has won a football game has nothing to do with why they won it. Please keep wikipedia factual. I don't care if you add in my statement, as long as you remove the old one because there is simply no evidence. This is why we can't have nice things... http://theperfecthorse.blogspot.com/2009/07/white-hooves-vs-dark-hooves.html  â€” Preceding unsigned comment added by rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[34mMontanabw: Your little blog is not a RS.  The article does not state that white hooves are weaker or inferior, nor is it implied.  I am not making an argument that the horse has weak feet, we are stating what the trainer himself said.  We are going down a rabbit hole per WP:UNDUE to add all your commentary about "debunked" and "superstition" when in fact, the studies are small and though indicate that both colors of feet are similar, they are inconclusive as far as "debunking" (particularly when the same horse has two different colors of feet) due to small samples and lack of clear design (one study sounds like they used cadaver hooves). Even these studies indicate that there ARE a few differences in things like moisture content. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH4: Repeated argument
[36m216.227.122.184: It is not "my little blog" I have no idea who writes it,  and I pointed you to it because it speaks to why farriers and other horse people are reluctant to change their views even when presented with scientific evidence. Basically, because people hate to be wrong. The California Chrome article DOES state that they are more prone to problems, which implies that they are inferior. You are not directly quoting the trainer, so this implies that you are stating it as fact. The links I posted point to scientific studies that show that white and black hooves are structurally the same. You keep complaining that they are old studies, yet you leave the statement about white feet in there even though you have yet to produce a scientific study that backs you up. There are plenty of people who hold all kinds of misconceptions, and it's articles like this that perpetuate old wives tales over actual scientific evidence. This is the same reason people don't vaccinate their children, because they don't understand how science works and they think they are smarter than their doctors. Of the 2 horses currently in my barn, I have an OTTB with 4 black hooves that chip like nobody's business, and a welsh cob who has a white foot which is like iron and the farrier has to work hard to trim it, but one of her black feet has a quarter crack. By your observational logic, black hooves are weak. Thankfully scientists don't rely on weak correlation and anecdotal evidence. Leaving this in here is why professors don't allow wikipedia as a reference for research papers... rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument

Because all four of his legs are white, California Chrome's hooves are white as well. It is a superstition among horsemen that white hooves can be softer than dark-colored hooves,[15] and are thought to be more prone to developing problems.[16] This however, has been debunked by several scientific studies and would have no impact on his hoof health. ^new citation

[34mMontanabw: And now you are edit warring.  The material you have cited now is by Jaime Jackson, who is a WP:FRINGE practitioner with little credibility in the mainstream.  This is most definitely not the place for the "barefooter movement" to start pushing their fringe theories.  This article has NONE of your "inferior" rants in it, merely a statement that is sourced about one horse's generally healthy - but white - feet.  Read what it says and read the source material.  Remove this content again and I am going to report you as a vandal. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[36m216.227.122.184: It is published in the american farrier journal, so I guess you don't believe articles in medical journals either and rely only on your own anecdotal evidence when it comes to decisions about your medical treatment. Your own citations are about as informative as "we interviewed a hospital orderly, and he said you can catch a cold by standing outside in the rain" the person making the statement is not a medical professional. You have still failed to provide a source other than the trainer's statements that white hooves are softer and more prone to problems which if "more prone to problems" isn't another way of saying "inferior" I don't know what is. Those exact words are in the article and they are what I object to. Your average person is not going to click on the citation and make the judgement "oh, the trainer is saying this and it might be an old wives tale" they are going to take it as fact that white feet are more prone to problems. When you can come back with ANY peer reviewed study, even just one, that says that white hooves are softer or more prone to problems, I will shut up. Otherwise you are abusing your privileges here and inserting your own pseudoscience and agenda. I have no agenda here as a "barefoot movement" person, because I am not one. My OTTB HAS to wear shoes or her feet fall apart, the other one is barefoot most of the time because she has feet like iron other than the quarter crack which we just manage with strategic trimming and she stays sound. I recognize this as a consequence of genetics, and not hoof color, and I realize that some horses have great hooves, and others are probably going to always need shoes, especially competition horses that have unnatural strain placed on them. As someone who is a scientific professional, I can look at evidence subjectively and not just go by tradition or old wives tales. I can't just go by my own opinions or something that someone told me once that may or may not have any evidence behind it. So again, please provide me with ONE STUDY (not just a person's statement) that shows that white feet are "more prone to problems" or "softer" and cite those in the article, and I will stop pestering this board.  â€” Preceding unsigned comment added by rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Repeated argument
[36m216.227.122.184: Trade journals are still more reputable than your opinion/observations/anecdotes or the superstitious comments of one trainer in a sport full of superstition and tradition. The link that froggerlaura provided indicated only that there was one anomalous white foot in the study. I saw no reference to "more moisture" and being softer, so if you would provide a paragraph number I would be appreciative. I'm not arguing that this is an area that has been exhaustively researched and all scientific conclusions have been made, what I am saying is that thus far, all of the results point to there being no difference between colored and white hooves. You have not yet given me any study that disagrees with that (unless you can provide previously mentioned paragraph numbers and they do in fact confirm your moisture statement) so to leave in the statement as written, even later in the paragraph leads most people reading the article to believe that there have been studies that show white feet are inferior, thus perpetuating the myth. The statement doesn't even have any added value to the article, other than to say that he started to have problems with his feet. The whole part about them being white is completely irrelevant. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[36m216.227.122.184: As for my credentials, I have a masters degree in engineering (yes, I have literally taken "rocket science" and there are classes that are harder than it, so saying "it's not rocket science" is a joke in our field) but I happen to have a background in biology as well and have owned horses my whole life, many of which were OTTBs and were a complete mixed bag of hoof strength even though all of them have had black feet except for the most recent cob cross. If anything, rather than silly rhymes about hoof color, I'd just say don't buy a straight thoroughbred if you want a horse with good feet. And lest you think that I regularly troll the internet spewing my hatred of misinformation, I only came across this when I was looking up info on CC after his loss. I had remembered reading previously that this myth had been debunked, and a quick google search told me that most reputable farriers are no longer telling their clients this, so it bothers me to see it still showing up on places where thousands of people are likely to be influenced by it because they're unlikely to dig any deeper.  â€” Preceding unsigned comment added by rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mFroggerlaura: While I agree that more study is warranted in the "white hoof" debate, California Chrome is not the right article to either prove or disprove the theory. Since the statement about the hooves is contentious, how about just starting the paragraph as "While in training, California Chrome has had problems with his feet" without going into the debate about why. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mMontanabw: The American Farrier's Journal is a trade publication, not a "medical" journal and Jaime Jackson is a person who espouses fringe views. Perfect horse is John Lyons' publication. I have looked at the studies that are out there, there are a handful.  They indicate, as Froggerlaura noted above, that the structure of white and dark feet is not significantly different: "no structural differences in the hoof wall keratins."  But that's as far as they go. One of them does indicate the feet with more moisture are softer and more prone to falling apart. There are no studies that are particularly comprehensive, most have small sample sizes, they don't sound like they used live hoof tissue for some of them and their conclusions are, at best, preliminary.  So your frothing and ranting on the topic is not winning me over here. I am not going to argue about our relative credentials because on the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog. Let's just say that I too can read scientific studies, and I can also see when a "scientific" study is not particularly well designed.  If it will placate you, I can switch the order of the paragraph so the hoof structure thing is not what leads it, but that's as far as I am willing to go.  In this case, verifiability is what we have from the sources cited, and no one is saying the horse has weak feet, in fact, the evidence is the opposite. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mMontanabw: No one seems to be reading the actual article or the sources cited. He didn't have problems with his feet, other than low heels (which seems to be a common thing n TBs), the point is that they are careful and care well for his feet.  I will do a minor rephrase, but "superstition" is not what we are talking about here, and frankly, we've all got advanced degrees, we've probably all taken some biology classes too (and in my case, equine management, FWIW) and yes, I too have "owned horses all my life." So I am not impressed by some anonymous IP who ctes a fringe theorist. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[36m216.227.122.184: No one seems to be reading the sources cited is EXACTLY the point I was making. If your average wikipedia reader were to look at this article, they would surmise that white feet are more prone to problems a statement that you are still making in the article even though you have changed the order. I agree with Froggerlaura's recommendation, which makes this debate 2 to 1. If you're going to continue to lord your administrative privileges over me just because I was too lazy to create a wikipedia login (and by the way, my anonymous ip is no more anonymous than a username like Montanabw, I have no qualms providing you a link to my linkedin article to establish who I am since if you're crazy enough to try something violent based on that, you could still find me based on my ip). I "cited a fringe theorist" in one article, and while he is an established farrier the other studies does by DVMs that I also linked to back him up, and they are the stronger studies, yet you keep going back to the one study. Unless you are going to say you are a DVM (I'm guessing not or you would have stated as much) last I checked that was the highest qualification for equine practitioners, so unless they all are "fringe" you can't dismiss their studies. And I'm still waiting for the one study that says that white hooves are softer that you keep talking about. STUDY not quote please.  â€” Preceding unsigned comment added by rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[35mLaurelmw: Montanabw - what you are describing is the difference between science and belief. Many people believe that white hooves are softer or more prone to problems, but that does not mean that science agrees with that belief. A perfect example is religion: There are many people who believe that the world is only a few thousand years old because the bible says so. Scientific study shows otherwise. We would not include that as a statement in an article about the history of our planet and then link back to a quote from a trade journal (in this case bloodhorse, but in the religion example, some christian publication) or the statement of a trainer (in the religion example, a priest/pastor) because it would be misleading and inaccurate. Currently the science contradicts your statement, and for clarity it should not be included as an implied "fact" in this article. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
