[31mJoe N: With regards to the edit on the Vyborg-Petrozavodsk Offensive, the information is not dubious, and I have added citations to reliable sources for it. The Werth source clearly says, on page 906 as well as where the citation is, that Soviet forces had "stopped at the 1940 Finnish fronteir, and did not go beyond it. They were giving the Finns time to reflect." The Wright source also clearly says that they stopped voluntarily, on or slightly past the 1940 border, on page 343. "On June 15, the Finns were forced to draw back to their final, VKT Line, which streched from Viipuri to Kurarsaari, then east along the Vorksi river to Taipale." While I agree that this line is not across the Finnish border, it is very near it. Also, your wording on the footnote is not particularly NPOV ("shattered"?) I would question the "unable to fulfill the orders" quote as well, it contradicts what both my sources say. rebuttal_labels::

[32mWhiskey: One task, which I have found really frustrating is the fight against ignorant historians writing in English who are using solely Soviet second and third hand sources and thus repeating Soviet war-time and post-war propaganda. Even Glantz is not immune on that, as witnessed his inclusion of South-East Army to the Finnish OOB in his book about Leningrad. Finnish language is not the easiest one, but one can get a couple embarrasing moments less if one bothers to check facts from the both side sources. But to the facts on the ground... rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mWhiskey: ...very near it. At the closest point at Vyborg, Soviets were about 40km from the border, at Taipale they were almost 150km from the border.
Wright is correct in stating that Finns retreated to VKT-line, but his wording confuses the fact that VKT was the final line in the sense that Finns were able to stop Soviet advance there and didn't have to retreat to the Salpa line, which was still behind VKT. And at least from the quote you gave, there is nothing about voluntary stopping of Soviets. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mWhiskey: shattered Instead of this word, I could have used the following: "Most of the men of those two divisions were able to escape Finnish encirclement by abandoning all their heavy equipment, artillery, trucks and mortars and fleeing through the roadless forest with their handarms. After they reached Soviet lines, they were forced to spend several months to recuperate from the losses and wounds, and before their heavy equipment were re-equipped." Better? rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mWhiskey: unable to fulfill the orders is a direct quote from the Platonov's book, which is generally considered official Soviet military history of the Siege of Leningrad. It is supported by archive material about messages between STAVKA and Marshall Govorov, see Talk:Strategic_operations_of_the_Red_Army_in_World_War_II#Vyborg_operation_dates. It was only later, when politically correct historians started to interpret things when the idea of Soviet voluntary stopping was invented. It was just as voluntary as German stopping at Bastogne. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mWhiskey: You should be critical about your sources and not parrot everything they say. Basically, you have two books written by British/American historians, and your interpretations of them, based on the quotes you have referred, as they seems not to say directly that Soviets stopped voluntarily. I have both Finnish (Maanpuolustuskorkeakoulu:''Jatkosodan historia 4-5'') and Soviet (Platonov et al.:''Bitva za Leningrad'') official histories and both Finnish (Sota-arkisto) and Soviet (CAMD) archival material to support my view. I'd say third hand sources vs. first and second hand sources. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[31mJoe N: Oh, what rich irony. I am either criticized by mrg3105 for not using enough Soviet sources, or you for using too many. The Werth book is written by a Brit living in Moscow as the BBC corespondent during the war. Therefore, it seems that these two potential biases would cancel out and he would produce a fairly neutral book, which I have found him to have done, so far. He states twice that the Soviets stopped voluntarily, to give the Finns time to consider peace terms without using more men and supplies to continue the offensive, which was taking heavy casualties. Glantz's book When Titans Clashed also clearly says on page 202 that the Soviet Offensive went well. Regarding the shattered, I'll try to rewrite that to be better and less lengthy than what you have. And about sources - Wikipedia sources should be secondary sources, as written by historians, not primary sources interpreted by individual Wikipedians, which comes awfully close to WP:OR. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation, DH5: Counterargument
[32mWhiskey: No, I don't criticize you using too many Soviet sources, in fact you are using too few. And what is even more distressing, you are using *only* Soviet sources. I believe Werth is trying to give unbiased view in his book, but as he a)relies only an information from one side of conflict and b)doesn't have all relevant information available (Platonov's book was released in the same year as Werth's), he is not able to express a balanced view. This is clearly indicated in his claim that Soviets stopped voluntarily, as it clashes against the direct STAVKA order to Govorov:"...1. To armies of the Leningrad front, acting Karelian isthmus to continue approach with a task 26-28.06.1944 the main forces to take possession a boundary Imatra, Lappenranta, Virojoki. A part of forces to attack Keksgolm, Elisenvara with the purpose of clarification from the opponent of Karelian isthmus to northeast from the river and lake Vuoksi. 2. In the further the main forces to develop approach with a task to take possession boundary Kuovola, Kotka and will be fixed on east coast (bank)of the river Kjumin-Joki. To provide the main grouping from the north...", which was published after his book was released.
Glantz is correct in a sense that offensive went well ''until June 20''. In fact it went perfectly, just according the timetable, facing less opposition as was presumed. But then it hit to the wall. Platonov, coming from the military, and unaware of any political and ideological pressures, states:"The repeated offensive attempts by the Soviet Forces failed ... to gain results. The enemy succeeded in significantly tightening its ranks in this area and repulse all attacks of our troops ... During the offensive operations lasting over three weeks, from June 21 to mid-July, the forces of the right flank of the Leningrad front failed to carry out the tasks assigned to them on the orders of the Supreme Command issued on June 21." The net result of this was a total amnesia among the historians: The Vyborg operation end date was set to June 20, although Leningrad front suffered more casualties in offensive operations after that date than it suffered during the previous eleven days. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mWhiskey: Regarding the sources, the first hand sources can be used also in Wikipedia to prove exactly what they say (WP:OR#Primary.2C_secondary_and_tertiary_sources). In this case it is an intention of Soviets to go further than Vyborg. Then I have Platonov to do second hand interpretation of the issue:"...failed to carry out the tasks assigned to them..." I really presume that Werth was unaware of this order, as it stretches my imagination too much how that order could be interpreted as a "voluntary stopping". rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mTermer: NPOV: Please note that
According to the European Court of Human Rights European Court of Human Rights cases on Occupation of Baltic States, the United Nations Human Rights Council , the governments of the Baltic countries, the United States, and the European Union, the Baltic states were occupied by the Soviet Union.
Therefore the use of liberation in the article is not factual, even though liberated from the German occupation ,that followed is considered Soviet Occupation according to the sources above. The only source that is in disagreement with this is the Russian government. rebuttal_labels::

Sorry but I don't see anything or any sources referring to this in the text that would refer to it as "according to Stalin". And even if this is fixed, you'd need to add the majority viewpoint to the article in order to maintain the WP:NPOV rebuttal_labels::

[31mJoe N: this page, linked to in the footnotes section is the source, and when it is translated into English on Google then you can see that, although the translation is imperfect, it still says, in relation to the Crimean offensive "As a result of the attack were released from a German yoke of Crimea and Odessa" In relation to the Offensive against the Finns, "The result of this attack was to liberate much of the Karelian-Finnish Soviet republic." In relation to the Belorussian Offensive (Bagration) "took to the Neman and freed most of the Lithuanian Soviet republic." In relation to the Lvov-Sandomierz, "released Western Ukraine," for the Baltic Offensive "a) was released Estonian Soviet Republic, b) was released most of the Latvian Soviet republic," and for the ninth offensive listed "a) our troops have had direct assistance to federal Yugoslavia, we in the expulsion of Germans and the liberation of Belgrade, b) our troops were able to move through the Carpathian mountain range and to reach out to us the Federal Republic of Czechoslovakia, part of whose territory has been liberated from German invaders." While the translation is imperfect, you can still understand the message he is conveying.   I would be willing to compromise, using the generally accepted titles for the links and stating in each paragraph the title Stalin gave it. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
