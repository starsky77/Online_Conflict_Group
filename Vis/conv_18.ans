[31mDBigXray: Canada PM in lead rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mDBigXray: The statement of Canada PM is added in lead as it is an important declaration of the National Policy and Canada's view point of this movement. please check WP:WEIGHT and WP:LEAD. That fact that it is there in the article body below is not enough justification to remove it from the Lead which is a short summary of the article. '''' rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mElephanthunter: It wasn't a statement of national policy so much as an assurance to Singh himself, who had repeatedly accused Canada of supporting the Khalistan movement. We can have it in the lede under two conditions: 1) In the context of said accusations and 2) If we mention Trudeau said this to Singh himself. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mDBigXray: Kindly accept my request to read the page of WP:LEAD first, and then we can talk. Without you reading that page I an sure, this discussion will be futile.'''' rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mElephanthunter: You actually caught me in the middle of updating my reply to say that, if the Canadian Prime Minister was merely reassuring Singh, that means it is probably not content for WP:LEAD anyway. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mDBigXray: Please confirm that you have read the whole page of WP:LEAD and WP:UNDUE today, even if you have read those in past. It is easier to to discuss when we have  aclear understanding of the policy. '''' rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mAdamgerber80: Please discuss your changes here first. I think you do not understand some Wikipedia policies based on your WP:OR earlier. I am also awaiting your response on another page. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mElephanthunter: Adamgerber80, it's disingenuous to make an edit and then ask that I discuss my changes first. Also, you can't just take a statement out of context and then claim WP:OR. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mAdamgerber80: Currently you are changing a lot of content and not just moving it out of the lede. I am referring to your earlier edits that "the movement was being downplayed by India". Even now,  where you have changed the mention of Sikh radialization (which does not violate NPOV) and changed the meaning of the sentence. Please discuss your changes here. rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[32mElephanthunter: I am trying to engage in civil conversation with you. Please just speak your mind an explain calmly. I've read and (just now) re-read the sections on WP:LEAD and WP:UNDUE. My point is, to quote Trudeau as if he was not responding to Singh's accusations misrepresents the situation. That's all. But further, that context changes the weight of Trudeau's comments. After re-reading WP:UNDUE I think it becomes less obvious that Trudeau's comments belong in the lede. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mElephanthunter: We did have a discussion about the word "downplayed" just above, and I don't believe you responded to me. rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[34mAdamgerber80: Because I was still awaiting your answer on the other page which is related to this. Also, please stop creating your own rules about NPOV and respond to the queries that have been raised. Please refrain from editing the page unless we have cleared these issues. rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[34mAdamgerber80: Your edits are getting very disruptive currently and it seems your understanding of WP:NPOV is incorrect. Please discuss these edits here. And I did not follow you to this page. I have been editing and watching over this page for a long time (including 24 May, 19 May, 29 April, 22 April, 17 March, 7 March, 25 February to name the latest ones). Please look at the page history before you make baseless accusations on other editors. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mElephanthunter: you came here to make edits after attempting to remove Khalistan from List of active separatist movements in Asia. There you were censoring this group, making the argument they are "inactive" (which is false), and then when you claimed the group does not exist within India (even though Indian citizens are being arrested?) It was confusing, to say the least. And now you care about WP:OR, WP:LEAD, etc. but only when anyone makes any update that doesn't paint this group as extremist. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[34mAdamgerber80: I have answered to the inclusion of this on the talk page there. I am currently discussing content based on sources and Wikipedia guidelines. Unfortunately, it seems either you do not understand these rules or do not want to follow them making it a case of WP:IDONTLIKEIT. Please discuss based on sources. Just because some India citizens have been arrested does not make an entire movement active again. This is where your WP:SYNTH comes in. On your point of militant and extremist, these are WP:NPOV words on Wikipedia and have been used across multiple pages and are supported by sources. Please discuss on these basis. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mElephanthunter: Just because the words "extremist" or "militant" are used on other pages does not mean those words are suddenly NPOV in all situations. You're pushing an Indian nationalist view pretty hard here, but Wikipedia articles should stay professional and neutral. Also, I am familiar with Wikipedia's rules. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[34mAdamgerber80: If you are indeed familiar with the rules of Wikipedia then please explain to me how is militant violating NPOV here? If a WP:RS is supporting it, then it can be included. Wikipedia does not allow using the word terrorist which puts this in the negative light. Any movement which takes arms is referred to as a militant (I hope you get this). Also, please reply to concerns I have raised earlier on how you arrived at this movement to be "active" on the relevant page. Lastly, please do not attribute anyone to a view and treat everyone with respect (the same way I have treated you with one and not called you a particular side or the other). rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH5: Counterargument
[31mDBigXray: Thanks for re-reading the WP:LEAD and WP:UNDUE again on my WP:Civil request. we will descuss the disputes in order. please respond immediately after the subthreads to prevent confusion.
''Dispute 1: the word "MILITANT" and "EXTREMIST" vs"GROUPS" and "SUPPORTERS"''' rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mDBigXray: As I can see your reply above. It is clear that you consider the word "MILITANT" and "EXTREMIST" as non neutral. Please share your source supporting this claim (with link to exact policy and Reliable source).  If you really are familiar with Wiki Policies this should never have arisen in the first place. Armed murderers and shooters cannot be mentioned in the article as mere Supporters. WP:NPOV does not mean Facts will be watered down in a motivated effort to make them appear more palatable. You should immediately go and read before responding Wikipedia:NPOV means neutral editors, not neutral content '''' rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mDBigXray: ''Dispute 2: adding CANADA PM Statement in LEAD''' rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mDBigXray: If you have really read the WP:LEAD as you say, can you explain (with link to exact policy and Reliable source)  why you feel that CANADA PM statement about ''DENYING SUPPORT to revival of KHALISTAN'' does not deserve to be in LEAD ? '''' rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
