[31m71.76.189.11: Neutrality rebuttal_labels:: 
[31m71.76.189.11: The recent edit by 96.231.117.108 smacks far too much of political advertising, which is far beyond any standard of neutrality. Lines like "Congressman McHenry has fought for adequate veterans' health care for his district." are clearly stuff from his own campaign- any Congressman in the world would say the same thing, and it's not necessary to list out his individual votes like merit badges for an overgrown boy scout. If someone doesn't edit this, I may, but we need to somehow retain the important information and get rid of the blatant self-promotion going on here.  â€”Preceding unsigned comment added by rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mZiegfest: I'll take it up right now, and I invite other (legitimate, non-McHenry) guys to work with the material as it stands. I'm making the decision to remove much of the Hickory Clinic, as many current Congressmen work on similar projects and Wikipedia has yet to chronicle those- it seems needless, lest we all want to begin documenting in excruciating detail every vote made by each Congressman. In addition, a lot of it references back to his website- reads like an ad, go figure. Anyway, thoughts on my edit (coming up in about 10 mins)? rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mZiegfest: Quick note- McHenry is not involved in H.R. 1616, according to info- which isn't even the bill mentioned. I attached the only one that appears connected to the whole meth topic, but correct me if I'm wrong. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mPotus128: You are incorrect.  I have updated the page with the cite to his legislation, H.R. 1616, which was incorporated into larger legislation.  The text (including bill number) can be found here: http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.R.1616: rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[36mYstava: I removed the last two external links because they both violated NPOV. The second one is a blog that is poorly sourced. Some Members of Congress have external links to their state or national political party, but I can't find any that have hate sites in the list. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mZiegfest: Added them back. The blog is well sourced and referenced in a few newspapers (both the Hickory Daily Record and News@Norman). To remove the link would be to unfairly balance the article pro-McHenry, and honestly, it's only a link anyway. McHenry's site is full of pro-McHenry information and clearly at the top, it's not as if readers will be unfairly biased- and in defense of the site, it is properly sourced even to Wikipedia standards. Far from "attack sites" such as Pat Go Bye Bye, which was on here for some time. To remove it would be meaningless- and considering it's been in newspapers, it's certainly wikipedia-worthy. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mPotus128: This blog is not in keeping with Wikipedia's standards on biographies of living persons (BLPs).  Specifically: "Be very firm about the use of high quality references. Unsourced or poorly sourced contentious material about living persons â€” whether the material is negative, positive, or just questionable â€” should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion, from Wikipedia articles, talk pages, user pages, and project space.[2]" rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31m71.76.189.11: Incorrect. Looking at the site, it contains sources to MANY reputable news and info organizations (The Charlotte Observer, OpenSecrets, etc). Just because it is negative does not make it poorly sourced- scanning the articles, it has more links than a Wikipedia article. From your history, you continue to try to add a blog laughably named "McHenry Rocks"- are we supposed to believe you? Nice try. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[36mYstava: Actually, the blog you are referencing that  repeatedly attempts to insert would not itself meet Wikipedia standards for WP:BLP. A sheer number of links does not indicate that the links are all reliable either WP:CITE. Neither you or  appear to be assuming good faith WP:CIVIL. Seeking mediation. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[36mYstava: The blog is ONLY referenced in two newspapers in a letter to the editor (both letters written by the same person whose POV is clearly not neutral). The article without the link to the blog is not pro-McHenry, it is neutral. The purpose of the article is encyclopedicNOT POV pushing as you keep doing. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[35m65.40.234.49: has been warned for breaking the three revert rule WP:3RR.  â€”Preceding unsigned comment added by rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mYstava: Adding links to help with help requests. First letter to the editor is here. The same letter to the editor was published in the Hickory Daily Record but does not appear to be available online anymore. After some searching, I found it on the writer's personal website here. I tried to resolve this with  on my talk page with no success. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mYstava: On August 7, the blog  keeps using for POV pushing seems to indicate that the editor is working with Ziegfest on this issue. This appears to be a huge violation of WP:COI. rebuttal_labels::
