[31mYobol: Sources used for medical information, in any article, is governed by WP:MEDRS ("specific attention given to sources appropriate for the medical and health-related content in any type of article").  Since the section you are adding the information to the "Nutritional value and taste" section is obviously health related, so sources used in this section need to meet WP:MEDRS.  The source you want to use, published here has multiple problems. The journal is not MEDLINE indexed, which is a huge red flag for medical journals.  The journal's stated scope is "the areas of cell biology, plant pathology and physiology, genetics, classical botany, and ecology, to practical agricultural applications"; it specifically is not a journal that published medical information.  Using a journal that is out of its stated scope to rebut information from journals that are in medical journals is not appropriate. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMontanabw: When supposedly "rigorous" studies are wholly funded by major corporations such as Monsanto, that too is suspicious.  It's remarkably easy to have a university researcher to publish favorable results  with unlimited funding.  We may also need to add some of the political issues as well. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMontanabw: MEDRS is not required for an article such as this one, which is within the scope of WIkiProject Agriculture.  WP:RS is all that is needed; peer-reviewed journals are fine, university published sources are fine.  Limiting source material to MEDRS would unnecessarily restrict reliable information on this topic.  It makes about as much sense as requiring a MEDRS source for citing info on the death of John Lennon rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mThe Banner: Nasty question: can you prove that the source we rely on, are really independent and neutral? Did you notice that ''every time'' there is a favourable report about organic food, it is followed by a report discrediting it? Strange at least. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mThe Banner: I would say that food quality and food nutrition is an agricultural concern, not exclusively a medical one. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mThe Banner: Monsanto into organic food? I don't think so. GMO is absolutely prohibited in organic production. Just look at the organic standards (at least the European ones)   Potential COI: I grow vegetables, non-organic. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mSecond Quantization: For future reference, the same food large companies make both organic and non-organic produce; organic food is highly profitable. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mYobol: No. The supposed health and safety effects are a major reason why people consume organic foods; flat out removal of the section is grossly inappropriate.  If there are problems with WP:DUE, it can be addressed without ignoring the topic.  Hand-waving objections about conspiracies by corporations are probably not going to go anywhere. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mYobol: Just a couple of comments to The Banner: 1) Pubmed is an international indexing, not an American one (as would be clear to anyone who searched the index for journals with the word "British" in the title - hundreds of results come up).  2) We should be using medical journals for medical information, and agricultural journals for agricultural information. I would have the same objection if someone tried to use the The New England Journal of Medicine or BMJ for purely agricultural info. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mThe Banner: Perhaps it would be better to remove the whole section "Health and Safety". First, scientifically it is a battleground. Second, the massive food industry will weigh in with their money, paying for scientific research that has a WP:COI. Third, the exclusion of sources, giving undue weight to the medical side of the story. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mThe Banner: Yes, on a second look it did not seem to be very reliable. But the part I added was based on a university study by an agricultural department. Not so likely to be included in een medical index, but, as far as I can tell, not an unreliable source, certainly not in its field of expertise. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mSecond Quantization: factorfizzle.com appears to be self-published, rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mThe Banner: So you lock out loads of scientific sources, even agricultural science, as soon as it contains health claims? That you need reliable sources, true. That there is a load of garbage disguised als articles, true. But starting to measure ONLY along the lines of a notorious difficult accessible medical index, makes no sense. That gives undue weight to the medical side of the article. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mBobrayner: It's inevitable that an article on organic food will touch on health - since nutrition (or avoiding consumption of pesticides &c;) is often perceived to be an advantage of organic food. It's reasonable to expect a MEDRS for that kind of content, especially due to the neutrality problems in this area (there are lots of lower-quality sources making very dubious claims). Outside that - say, content about farming techniques or the economic side - then of course we don't need a MEDRS. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[33mJytdog: Just FYI - Monsanto has a big line of vegetable seeds that are not genetically modified.  They breed new varieties that are valuable to conventional as well as organic growers. rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[32mMontanabw: I think the issue is here is a debate to use only MEDRS versus WP:RS.  There is no need for there to only be MEDRS sources here to the exclusion of other material that will pass WP:RS.  My point is that peer-reviewed literature and studies that appear in such sources are often not supportive of alternative views, and a lot of mainstream research is funded from corporate sources.  Thus, particularly in fields such as this one, to limit sources to only things that appear in Pubmed will, inherently, create a POV bias that is not appropriate for a comprehensive article, leaving behind only an anti-organic, pro-corporate agriculture viewpoint that defeats the intent of wikipedia and the NPOV pillar. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
