[31mMjolnirPants: In its first weekend of release, the film earned $8.6 million domestically from just 780 theaters, causing Entertainment Weekly's Adam Markovitz to refer to it as "The biggest surprise of the weekend...". In addition, the film added 398 additional theaters (almost 50% increase) after its 2nd week.

[31mMjolnirPants: ''EDIT''' I added the reflist template to make things easier, and modified the cited references to maintain a continuity of style. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMjolnirPants: ''EDIT''' I added three additional citations to the sentence about the urban legend, including two film reviews and an additional independent review per "notable persons or experts connected to the topics covered by the film may also be cited." rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mAnupam: Your proposal removes the "Christian appraisal" section entirely, which both User:User:LM2000 and I found useful. I do not see any issue with the section as it is (apart from your use of Patheos blogs in addition to the snopes and chick links). I mentioned that at WP:RSN and I'll be happy to go along with whatever the Wikipedia community decides there. Thanks, rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMjolnirPants: LM2000 did not state that he found the "Christian appraisal" section useful, he stated that he did not mind it. I myself do not mind it, so long as it is sourced properly and contains only notable information. The endorsements from athletes, purported quotes from Christian groups which are '''not''' reflected in the cited source and the mention of the filmmaker's religious practices are all excessive and should be removed. If you insist on maintaining a separate "Christian appraisal" subsection, modify the above proposal to one that excludes those aspects I just mentioned and watch me jump on board with you. As far as the patheos blog citation goes, Hemant Mehta is a notable person, arguably an expert on the issue of Christian/atheist confluence, and unarguably connected to the topics covered by the film.     â€” Preceding undated comment added rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mLM2000: My problem with this proposed version is that it is undue in its presentation of negative reviews, which is ironically the opposite of the WP:NPOV concerns I raised last night.  The Christian Post, National Review, and The Chattanoogan are WP:RS, as far as I know, and I don't see the harm in using Pure Flix Entertainment as a primary source.  I do not have an opinion on whether parts of this should be shortened or merged, or whether the section should be renamed, but total removal of the section does seem a bit much.  Surely some of it is salvageable. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mAnupam: I agree with User:LM2000's comment. User:MjolnirPants's version seems to present a one-sided version of the film. I agreed with User:LM2000's comments on WP:NPOV and supported his addition of ''The Washington Post'' and ''CNS'' sources to address that problem. It seems like there's consensus here to keep that section as the sources used therein are notable and reliable. As far as the Mehta source is concerned, I think that if we're going to leave it in, which I will do as a compromise to please you, we should attribute that statement to him in the article. Let me know your thoughts. Cheers, rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMjolnirPants: I'm fine with adding more positive reviews, however I disagree that the proposal above violates WP:NPOV because reviews of the film are -in fact- overwhelmingly negative. I'm not disputing  The Christian Post, National Review, or The Chattanoogan as reliable sources. I excluded them because they seemed to be citing the description of the filmmaker's religious participation. If they support something else, please add them back in. I have encountered a small number of positive reviews not hitherto included, and I've added those to the proposal above in the interest of reachign a consensus. I've also re-created the "Christian appraisal" subsection. Please review and comment. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mAnupam: Your revision is a little better, but is still unsatisfactory. It removes the quote from the President of Ratio Christi as well as all the organizations and individuals who have publicly come out to support the film. In addition, you supplant a deep quote by the Alliance Defending Freedom with a more lighthearted one. I still support the current version of the section. However, I would be open to removing the sentence that states "Some Christian youth groups in the Methodist, Catholic, and Baptist traditions are watching God's Not Dead together" as a compromise. Have you thought about attributing your urban myth sentence to Mehta yet? That's an issue that needs addressed. I look forward to hearing from you soon. With regards, rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMjolnirPants: I don't feel that an endorsement (which is patently '''not''' a review) is appropriate for inclusion in the article, especially given the apparent lack of notability from which it stems. Your 'deep quote' was not supported by the source, that is why I removed it. If you want to replace the one I have kept with that one, simply add an appropriate source and I will accept that. Your offer to remove a single sentence doesn't address the core issue, which is that your section puts undue weight on '''endorsements''' from Christian groups and extraneous information, when it should properly be about '''reviews''' of the film from Christian sources, or barring that; mainstream news media discussing the film's impact in the Christian community. I don't have any problem attributing the description to Mehta, but I should point out that given the number of sources supporting my claim, that would change the description of reviewers comparing the film to the legend from a mention that "numerous sources" make the comparison to a longer paragraph about all the individual reviewers who made the comparison. I've made an appropriate change to the proposal for your consideration, including removing some of the references. Please review and comment. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
