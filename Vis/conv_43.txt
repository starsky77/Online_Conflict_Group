Anyone educated about the two philosophies would agree that while the two do share a handful of traits in the broadest of strokes, to claim they are related ideologies would be silly. The same goes for anarcho-capitalism and anarchism. While anarchism and anarcho-capitalism both share the trait of wanting to dissolve/minimize the state, the similarities end there.

{'text': 'The problems with anarcho-capitalism and "national anarchism", the latter especially, are more fundamental than people not liking them or being "new". This is a debate about classification, not about the – to be frank, slightly odd-sounding – refrain about "hate" that keeps coming up (for info, you\'re not doing a very good job of selling anarcho-capitalism). People can assert on WP talk pages that ancap is definitively anarchism, but that is simply not what the record says. Yes, it is sometimes bracketed with it, but there is always nuance or even uncertainty and disagreement on the point, and WP needs to reflect that. Even the Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought, mentioned above in favour of the ancap-as-anarchism claim but not actually quoted from, describes it as "a tendency in the libertarian New Right", which as it happens is also "largely confined to the US" with "minimal" influence. Other sources are cited in this section of the ancap page, including Peter Marshall\'s \'\'A History of Anarchism\'\' – described by one newspaper reviewer as "the most comprehensive account of anarchist thought ever undertaken" – which has a small chapter on it but concludes that "few anarchists" would accept anarcho-capitalists as anarchists and that they might "best be called right-wing libertartians rather than anarchists". Even Murray Rothbard himself is quoted in that section disavowing the anarchist label, saying, per this piece: "We must therefore conclude that we are \'\'not\'\' anarchists, and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground, and are being completely unhistorical".
