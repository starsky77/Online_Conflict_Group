[31mMike4ty4: Casting the neutrality of this into dispute. Time for overhaul? rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMike4ty4: I don't like this. It seems to be advocating various nonstandard physical theories such as Andrei Sakharov's alternative gravitation theories. As it seems to be slanted toward these theories (as opposed to not having a slant at all), it feels as though it runs afoul of Wikipedia's Neutrality policies (NPOV). Does anyone here agree, and does anyone want to do something about it? It also suggests that zpf somehow is incompatible with the law of conservation of energy and that this presents a significant problem in physics. Yet I've never heard of an incompatibility between zpf and conservation of energy  this sounds like some sort of "Original Research" that is not appropriate for WP. Anyone really, really knowledgeable about physics in all the relevant areas want to examine the claims made on the page? They seem a little suspect. I also noted cites of Harold Puthoff, whom I consider suspicious as he seems to be "convinced" that Uri Geller's "psychic" claims are valid  yet from what I've seen, Geller has been pretty thoroughly debunked and exposed as an outright fraud and con man, though this of course is no substitute for a logical exam of his claims (though that itself is beyond the scope of WP  WP is concerned with reporting on things, not investigating their validity or lack thereof.). It just adds to the growing overall atmosphere of suspectness/dubiousness of the things expounded about on this page. I also find some statements on here a little odd. E.g. "In recent years, it has been suggested that the electromagnetic zero-point field is not merely an artifact of quantum mechanics, but a real entity with major implications for gravity, astrophysics and technology." However I'm not sure what physicists would call the zpf "merely" an "artifact" as though it were unimportant. I could be wrong on this, of course. And "One cannot invoke another world or universe to justify unjustifiable fluctuations just when it is useful to solve an inconvenient problem, as in the many worlds philosophy of quantum mechanics." This seems like a strange and peculiar slam at Hugh Everett's many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory  I have not heard of MWI being used as a "cop out" to push away inconvenient problems. Again I could be wrong, but this just doesn't seem good.
A great deal of information has been put into this article, making it highly complex and difficult to figure out what should be kept and rejected (there might be good stuff buried in there after all), and I think someone with both good expertise in physics and good neutrality should go over this and get it up to spec with Wikipedia policy. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32m75.7.12.4: Mike, there are many things you've said that don't seem to add up to a valid criticism. The main criticism seems to be that the information is non-standard. It seems to be based on the idea that all points of view should always be represented, even when subject is about one particular thing. Sakharov's representation of the zpf is one of the main sources of knowledge of the ZPF. Even now his paper on induced gravity is being referenced in a course on general relativity for cosmology at the Perimeter Institute, perhaps the leading foundational research facility for physics in the world. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH6: Refutation
[32m75.7.12.4: If you haven't understood that the zpf requires a huge assortment of unproven simultaneous things to make it unobserved then you just aren't thinking. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34m75.6.255.139: Mike, I'm afraid you didn't answer any of my rebuttals to your original challenge.  Until you answer my rebuttal arguments to the complaints YOU BROUGHT UP I will be reversing your banner in a little less  than a week. You defined the stage of battle and that is the stage I've acquiesced to and am argueing on. Now you want to change that stage because you know you don't know the history and cutting edge questions in physics today. Start answering my rebuttal in a physics context. This subject is about the physics of the zpf and not about physics that you might have read about 30 years ago. Established knowledge moves on, and that is what I've presented. You will have to move on also, your ignorance of modern physics and your perverse pride in that fact not withstanding. Eric Habegger rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mMike4ty4: This is not about the validity of the physics. The questions are about whether this is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia and in the way it is being included right here. That is what this is about. Also, what top, leading-edge physicists support all your views and theories? You say this is the cutting edge, so then it should be known to the top physics renowned the entire world over. You say it's "established" knowledge, so then you should find few physicists today that disagree with it. Do you? And there is no "perverse pride", that's crap and you know it. But you can call that a lie of course or something like that, so I'll never be able to convince you. And if I don't know enough about physics where the hell can I get more knowledge about it that would be more "current"? Apparently every source I've gone to to learn anything about physics and so on is all 30 years out of date regardless of the dates on them?! (Of course that's totally irrelevant to the WP policy issue.) rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mMike4ty4: Also, why don't you answer the questions, such as where am I saying that ZPF has not been observed, for example? rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mMike4ty4: So you believe the ZPF energy density actually goes down as the universe expands, so as to conserve energy? Or what? Also, the CMB radiation is not the ZPF, either. It's essentially leftover photons from the Big Bang. The ZPF of the EM field is what you're left with if you were to remove ALL photons (that's why it's called ''zero-point'' field!). As the volume of the universe increases the photons get more widely spread and also redshifted. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mMike4ty4: No, I'm not an "expert" in physics. But what I'm really after here is the appropriateness of the material for WP, which does not depend on the scientific validity of the theory involved. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mBenRG: Eric, this article is such a mess that I don't know where to begin. I prefer to end content disputes by coming to an agreement about the content, but I think that's hopeless in this case, so I'm going to stick with policy. Wikipedia is not the place to publish revolutionary paradigm-shifting ideas in physics. That's not what it is about. You can write about them on your own web site, or you can write an overview paper and try to get a journal to publish it; you just can't publish it here. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mMike4ty4: That's correct, that's what this is about: what's compatible with WP policy. I suppose if there was to be an "agreement" about the content, then he'd have to agree to that, and that would involve sticking only to published research and sticking to the neutral point of view. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34m75.6.255.139: BenRG, I think you should be much more specific about it being a "mess". As one example, the last section in which I mentioned the ratios of lengths that Feynman brought up, but with the only contradiction being "G". Now, it can be just left at that but we know more now than he did that there really is a cosmological constant that fits and that it isn't zero. He assumed G had to be right because he thought the cc was zero. It seems to me I'm just asking an ordinary question if G really is correct if we now know there really isn't a balance of positive zpf energy and something that completely cancels it. Is asking that question and delving into the suspected answer to be considered just a "mess" considering the fact that changing "G" would clear up just about every other conctradiction between gravitational physics and quantum physics? It does not seem like an arcane or complicated subject to be investigated even if there are not direct references.
How do you want to handle the "G" question? I have a feeling there are references related to this question that are relevant but I don't know where they are. You are assuming there are no references to this and that therefore the question cannot be asked. I would say the task for you is to find the references that are closest and then modify the subject matter to those references rather than do a wholesale alteration. I've put a huge amount of work into this article. Couldn't you make a small effort to find those references. The previous banner to have it wikified was justified but you are assuming its my job to do everything and if "I" don't do it then it has to be sort of destroyed. It seems to me the wiki community is just letting the article dangle in the wind by not contributing substantively with links and references. That's what the Wikify banner was suppose to promote. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMike4ty4: References are needed per WP policy. Furthermore, you should've put the references in while writing the thing, and also minded the neutrality. If you don't know where these references are, then I want to know where you're getting the information from that you have put in here. If it was in a book or paper or something, then that would be an initial first choice for a reference, but you might want to also consult Wikipedia's reliable references guidelines to determine if it would be up to snuff. If it's something you came up with yourself, then it's not suitable for Wikipedia unless someone else already came up with it and it is somewhere in a reference or you have had it published elsewhere in a sufficiently reliable outlet, all per WP's no original research policy. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35m75.6.251.17: I think you have assumed wrongly, in combination with my lack of references, that the main substance represents new research. But it is mostly just a different, and more physical approach to the subject. But it still seems to me that if both you and BenRG want to be constructive and not destructive, you would find the applicable references from the names I mentioned, including Feynman, and then harmonize the article regarding "G" with those references. I hereby assign you that job because Wiki is a group effort and no one person can do it all. I also still think that the Wikify banner covers the problems, including references, in this article. I think both of you have jumped the gun in declaring it POV without trying to find the references yourselves. If no references can be found for some of the subject material, THEN it may be profitably removed. Intuitive physical understanding and technical mathematic underpinnings often are two ways of describing the same things and I think you might be surprised how much reference material there is between the two things. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[35m75.6.251.17: Research in the term "original 'research'" is a little more broad than that: what Wikipedia means by the term original research includes "unpublished facts, arguments, speculation, and ideas; and any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that serves to advance a position." So the first question then is: is this "approach" (which I'd say would be an "idea") published in ''any'' source outside of Wikipedia? If so, what sources? The sources must agree with the reliability guidelines. There is also a "burden" on the poster of material to provide the necessary sources and citations, as well. I don't have access to academic libraries, so I myself might not be able to do the proper research to verify the claims and/or provide the necessary sources. Though I know I might not be able to, I nonetheless also know this likely can't be on here at least not the way it is written. Yet I see an awful lot of statements that seem to be making conclusions (some I mentioned) and statements that don't have references added, and that is what I was coming here to point out. So I'll ask again: where are you getting the information from? Where did you get all those statements from? As if you were getting them from a book, paper, etc. you could have referenced it, provided it met the reliability guidelines. You would not have to go and do some digging somewhere because you'd have the material right there! rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35m75.6.251.17: My proposal is this: both of you try to find "in good faith" the references to the problems you see in the article. I'm talking about references in established respected media and journals that agree with the article. One can always find references from prior knowledge that is out of date and that does not count. This probably will take a long time if you do that and then harmonize it with them. In the meantime I propose to delete the POV banner on the original timetable if you agree with that. In this way you will no longer have a problem with me taking over the subject matter for this article and you will be contributing substantively to the article and increasing your own knowledge of subject simultaneously. May I suggest you watch Feynman's first Messenger Lecture on the TUVA site for your first introduction to the G problem.
So where are you saying all this stuff came from, if not such media and journals?
What I'd suggest is that you should first review the neutrality policy, which among other things means that conclusions cannot be advanced in Wikipedia articles, and also that opinions in disputes must be weighted according to how widely they are held. And also the original research and verifiability policies, if you haven't done so already. If you have, my apologies, I just don't know. If these views and theories are not mainstream (though you called it "established" in one post), then they might not belong or might be only briefly referenceable in this article about "zero-point field", per the weighting guidelines section of the neturality policies, which is about that subject in general not a specific theory about it. If they are notable enough, they might be deserving of a distinct article. Even if not worth their own article, they may be includable in another existing article or articles  I'm not sure what they'd fall under as I haven't seem a name for the theories. I'd say you should consult with other Wikipedia editors, who may be able to advise you further in determining, for example, the notability of the theories, getting better references, presenting it from a neutral point of view, etc.
Finally, as long as this argument is still ongoing, I'd suggest the banner be retained as the argument/"dispute" is still going. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMike4ty4: I know it wasn't addressed to me but I thought I'd offer my comment. Also, it's not an "emotional response" to anything, it is rather a response based on what appears to be things that aren't suitable for Wikipedia ''per its policies''. Those policies are there regardless of any "emotional response". Also, you may wish to review the definition of the "wikify": Wikipedia:Glossary#Wikify "To format using Wiki markup (as opposed to plain text or HTML) and add internal links to material [i.e. to other Wikipedia articles], incorporating it into the whole of Wikipedia." If there was any "emotional response" it would likely have been to a few certain key claims, for example to the inclusion of giving certain views which I consider highly "pseudoscientific" a free pass in the "Related" section by saying "some consider them pseudoscience" but only in the middle of stuff that seems to buttress it. This "emotional response" though would be more because the views seem highly against science, esp. the "messages in water" thing whose discoverer even ''admits'' to the use of selective methodology in, which is pretty much useless insofar as determing if any phenomena are really occuring. Also, perhaps there was some "emotional response" that came later, when you seemed to refuse to answer questions in the above section about, for example, how ''your'' theories resolve claimed "pradoxes" like the constant zpf density vs nonconstant cosm volume thing, more like frustration really. However, emotional responses are an aside: the issue still remains, regardless of them, the compliance or lack thereof of this article with Wikipedia policy. Do you see what I am talking about? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mMike4ty4: I'm curious: have you subjected ''your'' ideas to the exact same level of rigorous examination you'd want me to subject mine to? rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[35m75.6.251.17: I'm a believer in giving people what they think they want. Only that way do they learn the hard work and contentious issues that come up. Therefore I will no longer contribute to this article or to Wiki. I'm only suggesting that you, or you and BenRG do the research on references that back up the information in the article. That way you'll have a clear conscience instead of just deleting things and suffering the consequences from others. I think I've had it with Wiki from this experience with you. Take it over and you and BenRG can make it into whatever you want. I don't want to turn into a defensive person by having to deal with blanket accusations from the both of you after doing so much work gratis. Bye. Eric Habegger rebuttal_labels:: DH-1: Bailing out
[31mMike4ty4: This is not "accusations", I'm just pointing out what the policy says, and why this doesn't seem to conform. You failed to tell me what sources you got what you wrote from, which I questioned you on because you seemed to make it sound like it would be a huge hassle for you to add the references, yet if you got your stuff from some other sources, then that's what you cite and citing them would not be hard at all since you know what they are! Do you see? If you made it all up yourself then it's not suitable for Wikipedia unless you have already premiered it elsewhere that is sufficiently reliable, per the original research policy. See? That's all I'm trying to say. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mMike4ty4: Oh and as for suffering "consequences", if the consensus of the community  which is something I'm still plumbing for as it seems few others have come to weigh in on this  is to delete, there are no "consequences" and no unclear conscience. I have already said that I myself am not in the position to be able to do the research myself, so I ''can't'' do it. I just '''''do not have''''' the '''''ability''''' or means to do the necessary work, as I have explained to your earlier. Learn well the difference between "not willing" and "''not able''". If the consensus is to trim, then it gets trimmed. If someone else with the necessary access and ability which I lack finds sources, then sources get added. If the consensus is the article could be saved but it requires a big rewrite to meet NPOV, then that's what happens. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mMike4ty4: And also, if you want to preserve the work, there's nothing that says you can't take that stuff you yourself did off to a website other than Wikipedia. You can even include stuff someone else has done, provided the distribution is done in accordance with to the licensing agreements (see WP:C). rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
