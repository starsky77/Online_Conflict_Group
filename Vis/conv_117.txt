Based on the latest June 30, 2017 guidelines from the China Netcasting Services Association, an organization subject to SAPPRFT, we could now see more clearly what content is on the radar of SAPPRFT. I do think the runtime columns are helpful from a mathematical/quantifiable standpoint to understand how much of a film is censored. With reasoning now given for most of the censored films, I do believe it's time to add back the runtime columns. I have already compromised on the arguments that runtime alone doesn't suffice and release year don't have to include exact dates for better tracking, but I reject the arguments that having these two columns are WP:OR, or still INDISCRIMINATE that do not have any encyclopedic values. No single website on the Internet has come up with such an exhaustive list. Let's make it great again by adhering to the last of the Wikipedia:Five pillars!

{'text': 'Thanks for pinging me. I strongly support restoring the run-time columns. I teach China film courses and do research on Chinese films. Run-times can almost always be sourced reliably enough, and are useful for recent films in telling which version you are getting.\nWhat raises questions and is NOT possible to reliably source is the reason for "editing." Somtimes it\'s censorship, sometimes even a film shown in a theater is a version shortened to show on TV, sometimes because the theaters want to sell more popcorn, or studio executives think they know better than the director, or because... well, who knows? All we should do, and we \'\'should\'\' do it, is give readers the running times in each country and let readers draw any conclusions. That is, no need for a column doing the subtracting (or addition, in some cases).\nAs I mentioned above, the "reasoning" is often unclear, disputed, or alleged, so I favor the "Notes" column.', 'username': 'CWH', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}

There needs to be some sort of defined scope for the article, we can\'t just list every single film that\'s ever been edited for release in China for every single reason. That\'s indiscriminate, see WP:INDISCRIMINATE. Every film listed on it needs a strong rationale for inclusion. IAR doesn\'t give you leave to go against consensus. This has been stated by a handful of editors other than myself, and you\'re just being dismissive and condescending. I understand what your point is regarding censorship in China, but the article needs a defined definition of it. Is that definition going to be "this film was edited in any way by anyone, voluntarily or not, for any reason"? Is that definition going to be "this film was changed under direction or pressure by a government body" (which is generally the more traditional definition of censorship)? If anything, I\'d say for a film to be included, you\'d literally need a source that literally has the word "censored" in it. Otherwise, we\'re speculating on reasons. And we cannot do that. It has been stated by other editors (including myself, to be transparent) that you\'re attempting to soapbox and advocacy edit and generally be tendentious on this topic to push a particular point of view, so your constant misconstruing of IAR to dismiss consensus and condescension just feels a part of that. ~Cheers,', 'username': 'TenTonParasol', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation', 'DH3: Policing the discussion', 'DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
