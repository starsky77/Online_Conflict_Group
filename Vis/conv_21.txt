Nor do sources suggest Young's recent resignation from the OfS board is linked with the clandestinely held eugenics conference at UCL, as was suggested in the additions I removed. While Young was present, sources so far are not suggesting he played an active role. Adding it to the summary was presumptive.

In the context of someone with some control over how schools are managed, Young\'s views on how we should use eugenics to possibly give the bottom 10% of society more intelligent children is enlightening.
