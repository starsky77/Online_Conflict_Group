While I agree BLP asks for strict sources and I also applaud DS for questioning the sources in the article, I believe he misses the spirit of BLP. The idea is that this is about a living person and so the facts have to be right. The facts in this case are poorly sourced, however, the facts are not as controversial as the edit warring (see above) indicates. The blog is from the person who the article is about. So if the source says a fact, it is not verified but it is not controversial. What we're talking about here is verification.  DS seems to be saying the fact is false in his use of BLP to delete and not allow for reasonable requests for scrutiny.

I apologize if I have mischaracterized you DS but you don\'t seem to be communicative unless you\'re reverting edits. Furthermore, when you are reverting others, there is no dispassionate or clear explanation in your editing comments (exampe: "erm, no"), which leaves me with the strong impression that this is more about a power game than it is about improving this particular article.
