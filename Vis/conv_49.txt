Now I'm not saying that the thing works, far from it, but no one is sure what is causing the thrust readings (error or otherwise), until someone confirms what has been causing the errors/trust there is no 'consensus' whatsoever.

It got far more attention in the scientific community than this topic, although the experimental claims are much weaker and the implication of an actual result would be much weaker as well (a new elementary particle vs. a complete breakdown of a fundamental principle of all modern theories in physics). So (2) is not the case. (1) is not necessary. If I claim that I measured the rotation of Earth and the result was zero, everyone would agree that I made a mistake - up to the point that most scientists wouldn't even bother to try to spot the errors.
