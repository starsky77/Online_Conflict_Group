[31mVolunteer Marek: Karasek, please don't try to edit war over this image . Your previous edit summary was that it is not "relevant to the history of the city". It very obviously is. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mKarasek: The Polish community dropped from a meagre 4-5.000 in 1918 to a statistically insignificant residue two decaded later. (Davies, Microcosm, page 361). 4-5.000 Poles in a city of 550.000 people means less than 1% were Poles in 1918. And many of them left after 1918. Please tell me why a shrinking community of less than 1% is notable and so relevant to the history of the city that a picture connected to this tiny minority has to be shown for this period of time? rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mVolunteer Marek: Because the city is now part of Poland. So the history of the Polish minority within the city is important and obviously relevant. The very fact that this minority is being discussed shows notability. Whether you IDON'TLIKEIT or not. There's no justification for the removal of the pic, or some of the removal of the relevant text, as you've done. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mKarasek: Less than 4.000 people in a city of 550.000 aren't a minority, they are insignificant. And as long as no one presents a source that proves that the allies decided to award Breslau to Poland because of the Poles in the city, or that the Poles in the city planned a coup d'Ã©tat to turn the city into a Polish one, they only represent themselves... a statistical footnote in a German city. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mMyMoloboaccount: Karasek..."in a German city" ? Wroclaw is a Polish city Karasek, I really find this statement strange.  Thus its Polish history is important, as demonstrated by its treatment in book on the subject by Davies. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mKarasek: In the mentioned era the city was German. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
