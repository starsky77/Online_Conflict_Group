{'text': '\'\'Delete\'\'\'. First, "the crowd is more alive with individuals holding up player signs, wearing costumes" appears to be a copyright violation from press materials, so that needs to be addressed. Second, if this is important, cite a reliable, secondary source and put it in prose.

We don't delete things based on that alone. We fix them. Not mention, I clearly state they are a lot of verifiable sources on this.

{'text': "A lot of video game series like the Call of Duty series has this problem of being hard to distinguish feature wise, but their entries here all have proper sections explaining their gameplay and development aspects without resorting to trivia-style lists. The difference is that these articles have received attention from experienced editors, whereas these lists are generally found on less popular games' articles, added by well-meaning, but inexperienced editors who are not aware of how video game articles should be written or specifically how new information should be added.", 'username': 'Eik Corell', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH4: Stating your stance'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'Here\'s a sample of what you\'re adding back to the Gameplay section: "Living crowds: On the next generation, the crowd is more alive with individuals holding up player signs, wearing costumes, and reacting authentically to plays. Over 9,000 new crowd models produces various different types of fans."\nHere\'s another: "New modeling system for players and equipment allows for dynamic cloth technology in the next generation, with the players\' clothes moving and affecting physics."\nThese aren\'t relevant to gameplay since they\'re graphical upgrades, and yet they sit in that section of the article, inserted in the form of list of all kinds of additions. Proper video game articles do not have these kinds of lists per WP:GAMECRUFT. WP:GAMECRUFT literally says that lists of gameplay items or concepts should be avoided, and states "Sometimes a concise summary is appropriate if it is essential to understanding the game or its significance in the industry.", and that\'s my point - This is literally a list of random stuff, including said gameplay items/concepts, nothing concise about it. It looks and reads like the additions of someone who is new to Wikipedia but haven\'t read the WP:VG/GL guidelines. It also makes the article seem like an advert. I know it seems like overkill to delete it, but the reason these articles stay in this condition is because nobody came along to do this in the articles\' infancy, and so new users come to the article and simply add more trivia to the lists they find.', 'username': 'Eik Corell', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}

{'text': "The New Features section doesn't belong in its current form; the information it has must be converted to prose kept within a gameplay section and a development section.

'''That's why those tags exist and what they are for.''' We don't delete content like that.\nWhat you are doing now isn't helpful to wikipedia in any way. You just delete content and don't explain what you think needs to be done. Deleting content then hiding behind guildlines that don't agree with you just makes it worse.\nYou yourself just said that if re written and in a full gameplay section it's fine.

{'text': "It's my experience that non-popular/uncared for video game articles generally sit with these tags for years with no improvement, that's why I delete such sections instead of tagging - This practice seems to be a much better strategy as far as yielding results go. I'm not familiar enough with these games to be able to write or write a gameplay section from scratch, and due to the other games' gameplay sections being like this one, I can't glean important information needed to write one from those, either. Check out the [[NHL_13|NHL 13] article's history for an example. That article has been in a similar state since its inception. I approach this whole issue from the angle that it's much worse to let a bad section stay in the unlikely hope that someone will come along and try to pry something from it or refactor it because I simply do not see it happening across the hundreds of video game articles I run across. It really only happens on popular articles with experienced editors present as I said.", 'username': 'Eik Corell', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH4: Repeated argument'], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
{'text': "You want to know why when you tag nothing changes? Because of editors like yourself. You delete peoples written content (do not even alert them on it) and then hide behind oh if I tag it, it'll just stay there. NO you tag it and alert the people who wrote it. (you know help those inexperienced editors inside of chasing away editors like you're doing now). If a year then goes by then you may have an argument. Right now you don't. Not to mention the fact, you seem to cite the same Guildine over and over again when you keep getting told (by now not only myself) that it doesn't apply. Then you restore your edits during an active discussion.

{'text': "I can't alert and constantly debate every single editor who's contributed to these unencyclopedic categories and lists that I routinely remove from articles, I mean we're often talking hundreds of editors adding to them over many years, although when they contact me, I make a habit of at least re-iterating what guidelines I removed them by. As I said, the tagging system works for well-frequented articles, not for these types of articles where experienced authors simply don't bother. In this case, the bad article quality isn't because nobody tagged the unencyclopedic categories. Editors experienced with the WP:VG/GL that actually take a look at all these articles seldom need these tags because it's not hard to see why a bullet point list of graphical features doesn't belong in the gameplay section. I generally do not add or rewrite stuff in significant portions because my presence here is primarily focused on cleaning up articles per WP:VG/GL, and that's what I feel most capable and comfortable doing. I've cited the guideline based on which I removed these lists. You're arguing for its inclusion, even though in its current state it's clearly in violation of WP:GAMECRUFT. Why don't you write it yourself? This would cut out any speculation about whether someone will or will not come along and eventually fix it.", 'username': 'Eik Corell', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH4: Repeated argument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
