[31mRobertiki: Yobol, could you explain me, why you killed any reference to:
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299912001471
? I am no physician, so could you explain me why that research is not relevant ?
The components look the same, what is the difference ? I am not after vindication or other crusades, I simply saw an interesting study. And any way, if it was really the suggestion of a vindication, is it so important ? And beside, there is not "one" truth, but all facts togheter help a better understanding. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mYobol: A discussion about di Bella needs to be sourced to a source that discusses di Bella.  Discussing it here when the source doesn't is original research. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mRobertiki: Sorry, but I don't agree. Encyclopedia articles focus on all factual information to cover the thing or concept for which the article name stands. When I search an Encyclopedia, I expect to find together all relevant information or at least references or links. What about accuracy, objectivity, impartiality and fairness ? There is always another side of the story. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mYobol: What you (or I) ''believe should be'' allowed is irrelevant. Mentioning material/sources that doesn't discuss di Bella is not allowed, according to one of Wikipedia's core policies. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mRobertiki: irrelevant ? Are we rude ? Anyway, I can't follow your reasoning. I read: "The term "original research" (OR) is used on Wikipedia to refer to materialâ€”such as facts, allegations, and ideasâ€”for which no reliable, published sources exist. How does the citation of a reliable and published source infringe on the OR prohibition? rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH5: Counterargument
[32mYobol: WP:SYNTH would be the appropriate section. Adding a source that doesn't discuss di Bella to make or imply a conclusion about his theories is not allowed. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mRobertiki: Wait! I did not reach or imply any conclusion! My text was: "After the death of Di Bella, the European Journal of Pharmacology published on 15 April 2012, a study received the 22th July 2011, titled: "Combined effects of melatonin and all-trans retinoic acid and somatostatin on breast cancer cell proliferation and death: Molecular basis for the anti cancer effect of these molecules". No implication and no conclusion. What I thought was: "Those interested, could look deeper at the study to see if it follows some how the Di Bella proposal." rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mYobol: Of course you did, by putting in this article. If you didn't mean to imply anything about di Bella, you wouldn't place it here. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mRobertiki: conclusion = termination, final result, proposition deduced from previous ones; what I had is a "indication" = point out, make known, show. I insist: in my words there was no conclusion. Some readers, may be, could hastily reach, one or another conclusion, but the most would do some reaserch, taking the link as a hint. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mYobol: You implied it by putting it in this article. If you did not mean to imply a connection to di Bella, you would not have put it in this article.  This article is about di Bella. It needs sources that discusses di Bella.  It should not use sources that do not discuss di Bella. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mRobertiki: True, I have implied a connection. But non a conclusion. The connection is that the study "recalls" Di Bella's research. But I have reached no conclusion. Connection and conclusion are not the same. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mYobol: Semantics aside, implying anything is not allowed. Implying something is WP:OR when the source does not make the implication. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mYobol: That source cannot be used in this article because it doesn't mention di Bella. I'm not sure what part of that you do not understand. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mRobertiki: Which form should the information have to include http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299912001471 ? Could you give some examples ? rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mRobertiki: How should be a source that discusses di Bella in reference to that research, to gain your approval in this article ? What qualifications should the author have ? Should it be peer-reviewed ? Where should it be published ? rebuttal_labels::
