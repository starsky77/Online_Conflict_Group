Use of psychometrics are a direct consequence of the cognitive revolution. Prior citations appeared to be biased against psychometrics, and included a lot of pop-science books refuting IQ tests. While books like the Bell Curve are certainly wrong in their interpretations, IQ exams are well validated with primary literature to support their usage.  —\xa0Preceding unsigned comment added by', 'username': '2601:D:2881:D20:ECF0:4A0E:ACF5:A68C', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Contextualisation']}

{'text': 'Do you have sources beyond books that decry the use of IQ exams? Where is the outcry of physicists against the SAT, ACT, GRE, or MCAT which are standardized psychometrics? As far as I can tell all of those exams are widely used with absolutely no outcry of the scientific community of peudoscience. I have supplied articles that discuss and give data on the validity of these tests in future performance, but I do not believe you read them. Most of the citations as listed in the article are in reference to claims that IQ tests assess innate aptitude, which is in fact not the scientific consensus now; instead it is now widely understood that the cause of differing IQ scores is multifaceted, but (and this is key!) they are not invalid at predicting future performance. Furthermore, your characterization of the issue as having been "beaten into a bloody pulp" is entirely misguided; did you not notice that psychological assessment courses are required for APA accreditation of clinical psychology programs? Or that psychometric work is accepted by APS journals? Or do you wish to question the validity and judgment of the entire field of clinical psychology? If you still have questions, I am more than willing to supply you with further empirical articles that clearly demonstrate the validity of psychometric data, which continues to be used in clinical, social, developmental, experimental, and biological psychology research.  If you can, I challenge you to clearly provide links to sources available online that provide support of this supposed "scientific consensus" against psychometrics, I would be glad to read them. —\xa0Preceding unsigned comment added by', 'username': '2601:D:2881:D20:18A1:2C6B:2A82:23F5', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}

In my opinion Trivers makes a better case against economics as, say, Gould does against psychometry, which I believe to have a better scientific grounding than many other branches of psychology.

"Additionally" does make sense as the first sentence is clearly describing a topic that is pseudoscience as IQ tests for example do not even measure what they purport to measure.  That is a widely accepted fact and one that has even been proven in a court of law.  It is impossible for any test to measure every aspect of intelligence in equal weight and thus it impossible for any test to measure "intelligence."  Further, it is impossible to isolate innate intelligence from learned abilities.  Measuring (metrics) elements of the mind (psycho-) is impossible.
