{'text': 'The entire article needs work mainly because it does not have reliable, third party sources and it reads like a fansite/advertisement. For example, the second sentence:\nThe game is free to play, with no monthly fee,[4] no premium upgrades, no micro-payments, and no advertising on the site or in game.[5][6][7][8]\nThis basically advertises the game\'s free nature. Simply stating "The game is free to play and is supported by donations," with a single source from a third-party publication, is sufficient to convey the point.\nThere are numerous other examples throughout the article. Feel free to make changes to address the issues.', 'username': 'N419BH', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}

{'text': 'Let me try it this way. Think in terms of "What are the most important points about this game?" As someone who\'s never played it or any other MMO, my personal opinion is I want to know it\'s free and I want to know it doesn\'t have advertising. Since it\'s not both of those I\'d like to know exactly how it pays for servers. However, I don\'t want to know it\'s free (no monthly fee), free (no premium upgrades), free (no mirco-payments), and free of advertising. Miscellaneous details do not help me understand what the game is about. Main points do. I\'ve personally read the article several times and frankly I have no idea what the game is about. Hence the article requires cleanup because it\'s heavy on detail and short on main points. We\'re not saying the article is bad and should be deleted. We\'re saying these are specific issues that need to be addressed by people who know (that\'s you) so the article itself is better and easier to read.', 'username': 'N419BH', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Providing clarification', 'Coordinating edits']}

{'text': 'One example is your recent edit to the character creator section. You added a source (good). However, the major issue with that section is a casual reader does not care what the names of the individual races are. There is currently no mention of exactly what is special about character development. The first part says it\'s good, the second part says all the details. There\'s no summary. As an additional bit of advice, try reading the article from the perspective of someone "out of universe". You\'ve played the game and know a lot about it, so you\'re "in universe". It makes sense to you.

Some of these sources are fine, I think we all agree on that, but some of them are outright poor sources and material based on poor sources isn\'t acceptable. You may want to read the WikiProject Video games guide to sources for a better idea of which sources we as a community value and those which we don\'t.\nI will also again ask that you refrain from removing maintenance tags that \'\'multiple\'\' editors feel are necessary.
