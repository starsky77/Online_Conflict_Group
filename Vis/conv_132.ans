[31mIanmacm: Photo of gun rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mIanmacm: Re this edit:  is currently engaged in a spree of adding photos of guns lifted from Commons to articles about mass shootings. This isn't necessary or desirable. The guns are wikilinked, and the photos are not the actual guns used in the shooting. This gives a misleading impression. "File photo" is OK for lazy journalists, but Wikipedia articles should be made of sterner stuff.''''' ''''' rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mTapered: If the photos in the Commons aren't there, in part at least, to illustrate articles, what ARE they there for? Most editors don't have the time to search out and secure available photos. If you're moralizing ("lazy") wasn't an uncalled-for personal attack, it would be amusing. The suggestion that the '''only''' suitable illustration for the type of weapon used is the actual murder weapon is ''reductio ad absurdum'': absurd by definition. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mIanmacm: A photo of somebody else's Carcano rifle has no relevance to the assassination of President Kennedy. Here is what the actual gun looks like. WP:PERTINENCE says "Images should have significance and direct relevance to the topic, and not be primarily decorative. Finding good replacements is encouraged when removing poor or inappropriate images, but in some articles images may not be necessary." This is clearly the case here, as Bushmaster XM15-E2S is wikilinked and shows what a Bushmaster looks like. None of the images in this article pretends to be the gun used in the Sandy Hook shooting, and the article should be careful about not giving this impression. I wasn't trying to say that you are a lazy journalist, but when a lazy journalist cannot find an image of something, they often go to the library and find and image of something similar. Wikipedia articles should not do this. Here is a photo of Lanza's Bushmaster, taken from the documents released by investigators. This is what the actual gun looked like; note the considerable amount of wear on the barrel. I'm not sure that this image needs to be in the article as it is non free.'''''

[32mTapered: I'm glad you're not calling me a lazy journalist...because...get ready...I'm not...'''a journalist'''! I'm an editor. How is a picture of the model or type (for AR-15) of gun used not relevant? It's the essential instrument of these murderers. Your statementthat a picture of the rifle type or brand or model is irrelevantisn't backed up by any reasoning yoked to Wikipedia guidelines. You state it as an article of faith.  A photo of the actual weapon may have emotional value, but not more 'educational' value than a generic picture. Does a picture of the assassin have to show his/her actual clothes on the day of the murder?  I assume that the reason for inclusion is to show readers what the weapon looks like. That's not "decorative," as per the guidelines you cited. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mIanmacm: Basically all that the edit did was to repeat the lead image in Bushmaster M4-type Carbine. This shows a "straight out of the box" gun on somebody's floor, shiny and clean and not at all like the actual gun used in the shooting. It isn't needed in this article per WP:PERTINENCE and could wrongly give the impression that it was the gun used in the shooting, as it had been positioned in the "Shooting" section. San Ysidro McDonald's massacre doesn't have an image captioned "Here is what a Uzi looks like." Wikipedia articles about mass shootings list the guns in the infobox and give wikilinks, and this is enough. Comments and thoughts from other editors on this issue are welcome.'''''

[32mTapered: Have chosen to wait a few days, will re-revert. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mTapered: First: your reversion has been reverted, with an explanation. Re: above You use words, but create strawmen (ex:"must be picture actual murder weapon, instead of useful photo for readers unfamiliar with firearms), and don't logically refute the arguments by tying them to Wikipedia guidelines. You mention pertinence, but don't explain why it isn't pertinent. Again, you write as if your assertion must be an article of faith. And thanks for the tip, I'll fix the San Ysidro article one of these days. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mTapered: Here's a pertinence explanantion, with some attempt at humor.
On the day of the massacre, his haircut was 3 weeks overdue, he hadn't shaved or showered for 2 days, and according to Mistuh Blackwell, his lime green shirt and khaki pants were horribly mismatched. This is grotesquely and obviously non-pertinent.
He had not taken his anti-psychosis meds for 3 days before the massacre. This is ''very'' pertinent, but a picture of the meds would be of minimal pertinence. They are not a direct part of the massacre. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mTapered: The firearm used is a ''direct'' part of the massacre, and as such an illustration/photo/image is useful. It does '''NOT''' have to be the actual weapon used to familiarize a reader with firearms, or help readers unfamiliar with firearms to distinguish between a Blunderbuss, a cap and ball revolver, or a modern semi-auto rifle or handgun. Or even between internal and external magazines, which I find isn't covered by Wikipedia's Rifle article. (More work to do.) rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mIanmacm: Given the amount of nonsense that has been written on the Internet about Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting conspiracy theories, it is not a good idea to show a photo that is not the actual gun. The photo of the actual gun was released as part of an appendix to the November 2013 final report, and is presumably copyrighted. Even if it was possible to cobble together a fair use rationale for the actual gun photo, adding it to the article would not add significantly to a reader's understanding. Does Port Arthur massacre (Australia) have a generic photograph of the guns used? No. Does Hungerford massacre have a photograph of the guns used? No. And so on. Wikipedia articles about mass shootings do not include photographs which are captioned "Here is a photo of the gun that I found on Commons. It isn't the actual gun, but it looks nice anyway." This has no value for the reader, who is quite capable of following the wikilink to the article about the gun.''''' ''''' rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mIanmacm: A better option is to give a link to the actual crime scene photos which are in the November 2013 appendix. This contains a wide range of documents and photographs from the investigation. The photographs start on page 168. The Glock, Bushmaster and Sig Sauer are on pages 174 - 176. The Saiga-12 shotgun is on page 178. The Savage .22 rifle used to kill Nancy Lanza is on pages 211 - 212. These images are of more value because they are the actual crime scene photos, not random images lifted from Commons. There are also photos of the school and 36 Yogananda Street.''''' ''''' rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mMasem: Unless details specific to the guns used in the crime are noted (which it does not sound like there were any) it would be inappropriate to use non-free in place of free substitutes per WP:NFCC#1. That said, I also don't think that the free gun images are really that helpful here, potentially glorifying the weapons used. Linking the weapons to their wikipages is just fine, but the images of the weapons do not really help here to understand the crime at large. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mIanmacm: The notable thing about the photograph of the actual Bushmaster used in the shooting is the amount of white powdery material on the barrel. Lanza fired 154 shots from the Bushmaster in the space of around five minutes, and the barrel of the gun was anything but clean. This may be due to gunpowder residue, but I am not an expert. It is a fair point that Wikipedia articles should not be gun porn and be accused of glorifying guns. Any photo of a gun should comply strictly with WP:PERTINENCE and not be used for decorative purposes. Even if the appendix photos of the actual guns were free of copyright, I don't think that anything of great value would be obtained by adding them to the article. The appendix is useful because it gives the photos in the context of the crime scene.''''' ''''' rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mTapered: @Masem. An image makes a key component of the crime "real" to reader. Connecting an image to a horrific crime could only glamorize it in the mind of an already disturbed, unwell person. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mIanmacm: You are going out on a limb here. Columbine High School massacre does not show photographs of the guns either, but there is a CCTV image in the infobox. This is in line with WP:PERTINENCE, random images from Commons are not.''''' ''''' rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mTapered: The gun photo can be labelled to make clear it's not the actual murder weapon. I'll make no concessions to conspiracy theorist types @ Wikipedia. They're already way beyond the pale. About the other articles, my reply is...not yet. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mTapered: You have more straw men than Mr. Green Jeans. Just because one article doesn't utilize an image doesn't imply that other similar articles ought not. You still have explained how an illustration of a murder weapon isn't pertinent, or why it's 'random.' Random would be a plate of ravioli. I've explained my rationale clearly. Please try a logical explanation to counter it. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mIanmacm: This is not a straw man. You have decided pretty much single handedly that Wikipedia articles about mass shootings should show photographs of the guns, then gone into WP:IDIDNTHEARTHAT mode when contrary arguments are produced. Please don't add ornamental photographs of guns to mass shooting articles.''''' ''''' rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mTapered: Since the crux of your ostensible argument purports to be the policy against strictly 'ornamental/decorative' images, citing only other comparable articles, I submit for all readers the article Robert E. Lee. I'd never read this article before, but I did pick it because I guessed that it would be 'image rich.' I hit a jackpot. I further submit that the images of 1) the window at the National Cathedral, 2) the Lee Corner properties, 3) the map of Fort Monroe, 4) Arlington House/Christchurch, 5) Lee astride Traveller, 6) Arlington House '#2', 7) Lee Chapel, and 8) the CSS Robert E. Lee are all of less importance to their article than an image of the murder weapon type is to this article. A murder weapon is a necessary/vital component of a shooting. None of those images are as important to the events that give Robert E. Lee notability as the murder weapon is the the events @ Sandy Hook. Aside from the numberous images of Lee (or his monuments), the map of Fort DesMoines is by his hand, and the Battle of Gettysburg is the defining event of his career. Please refute this with a few well-reasoned sentencesthat's what I've been requesting all along.
Alternatively, in the interest of consistency, I challenge you to remove the decorative images from Robert E. Lee. I'd do it, but that would be a flagrant violation of WP:POINT. FWIW, given your criteria, the stained glass window at the National Cathedral is most egregiously decorative of the 8 violations. It's beautiful. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mMasem: There is a vast difference between free images of works and buildings that are based on representing an influential person's life, and the weapons used by a spree murderer. It is a matter of taste and discretion. Yes, we need to identify the types of weapons determined to be involved, but it is absolutely unnecessary to show the reader those weapons to explain the tragic nature of this event. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mIanmacm: The way that things are done in Wikipedia articles about mass shootings is to give a wikilink to the article about the gun, and then let the reader follow it. Until  came along, everyone seemed to be happy with this arrangement. This is now getting to the WP:STICK stage, because there is no need for articles about mass shootings to repeat images that are already in the relevant articles about the gun.''''' ''''' rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mTapered: Wikipedia isn't based on taste, short of avoiding truly revolting images for shock value. Please address the salient points of my argument, or failing that, explain why the photo is "absolutely unnecessary" citing Wikipedia guidelines. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mTapered: Very often, the last refuge of someone who can't come up with a good, well-reasoned counter argument in a conflict situation is to say, "But that's the way we've always done it!" (A moment I while enjoy the imagined sound of the appropriate voicing!) In me, you encounter someone with '''NO''' reverence for custom for its own sake. Here, as I see it, custom needs be yoked, at least in some small way, to the Wikipedia guidelines. Next = dispute resolution. This is plainly insoluble. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mIanmacm: I would welcome a WP:RFC as we've started to go round in circles on this. Masem and I have tried to explain the situation but have not got very far.''''' ''''' rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mMasem: Per MOS:IMAGES "Per the Foundation, controversial images should follow the principle of 'least astonishment': we should choose images that respect the conventional expectations of readers for a given topic as much as is possible without sacrificing the quality of the article. Avoid images that contain irrelevant or extraneous elements that might seem offensive or harassing to readers." A picture of the guns used in a mass shooting ''will'' be offensive to some, and are not required to understand the crime, so they should not be included. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mTapered: The example cited for this issue is a pornographic image interpolated into a medical article. This image is no way similar or analogous to ''that'' example. If you're referring to political sensitivities, may all your edits be reverted forever. That's '''censorship'''. For my part I promise to post no photos (if any are available) of the moment that bullets collide with flesh, nor any photos of Jenna Jameson toying with her "firearms." rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mTapered: I'll see to it tomorrow or the next day. Promise. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mShearonink: Chiming in and hopeful that an RFC would be helpful.  Editorial consensus seems to possibly be against including generic photos representative of the mass killing murder weapons, an RFC would set down whatever the editorial consensus actually is and allow for outside closure (I asked a similar question at Talk:2013 Santa Monica shooting about the photo in that article of a generic AR-15 that has yet to receive any responses.) rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mMasem: That's absolutely not censorship, it's called being reasonably tasteful. We still mention the makes and models of the firearms used, linked to respective pages, and those are completely within encyclopedic information. ''But'' in terms of a violent crime, simply including images of the weapons used where their appearance does not impact the article can be considered offensive, glorifying the crime and tools used rather than the tragedy itself. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
