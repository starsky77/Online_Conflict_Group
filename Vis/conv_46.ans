[31mDiffeomorphicvoodoo: Please stop reverting edits without discussion on the talk page rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mDiffeomorphicvoodoo: The entries from the article were removed with good reason. The sources provided do not support the claim being made in the article for most entries currently in the article. Removing unverifiable claims is not overzealous deletion WP:ZEAL. The entries can be added again as sources are found for them. I have already started this process and added an entry with a source in an edit. Reverting to older edits is just undoing all this work. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mChunnuBhai: This is a new article, 3 days old as of now, and author may need time to add reliable sources. the wikipedia community can pitch in too. However, if most of the entries are deleted, the wikipedia community may not be able to pitch in. Its one thing to delete blatantly false information, and completely another to delete potentially true information just for the want of WP:RS/. in the latter case, "citation needed" tag may be placed instead of deleting some material altogether. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mRazer2115: This page falls in the borderline category of WP:HOAX and WP:ATTACK and with the influx of new editors, It is clear that this page is mentioned in some kind of forum or talk board. Please get consensus here on this talk page before reverting any more edits. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mChunnuBhai: , you have been deleting and reverting the edits too. Please desist from deleting material from a new wikipedia article. Wikipedia allows new authors the courtesy to have time to add reliable links to support the article. Lets us not pounce upon a new article. I disagree that this is WP:HOAX or WP:ATTACK. renaming schemes happen all the time, it is never a hoax. whether or not a separate page is warranted, is being discussed on AFD page. any propaganda material may be removed as per wiki. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH4: Stating your stance
[31mDiffeomorphicvoodoo: How do we know whether a claim is "potentially true information" in the absence of verifiable sources? I went through the sources mentioned in the article and for more than half of the entries, the source does not support the claim being made at all. Why should potentially false claims be retained on a wikipedia page, especially one that is generating a lot of pageviews? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mDiffeomorphicvoodoo: You have again reverted the article, despite the ongoing discussion on the talk page. This is you third revert on this article. This is simply not acceptable. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mChunnuBhai: Wikipedia assumes good faith on the part of authors, unless explicitly displayed. Absence of RS does not automatically imply false information. A new author as well as wikipedia community should be given time to verify the material in the article. Deletion of information must be based on falsifiability of information. current information is verifiable as well as falsifiable. if the information is demonstrated to be false, it should be deleted. Absence of RS in the initial stages of the article should not be a reason to edit-warring like behaviour while succumbing to WP:ZEAL. Page views have nothing to do with reliability of the article. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mChunnuBhai: I reverted the article to the point where information started to be deleted by various editors. Lets us give time to the author to post RS. In the meantime, you may please tag the entries with citation needed tag instead of outrightly deleting them. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mChirag: Added half a dozen sources. There is no original research in this article, just citations. Not sure why this claim has been made rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mDiffeomorphicvoodoo: That's because in more than half of the entries, the source does not directly support the claim being made. In many cases, the "source" is simply a link to an announcement or an evaluation of the old scheme, with no mention of the new scheme at all. The natural conclusion is that the author has compared the old scheme with the new one and it is his own claim that the old one has been renamed, which is original research. rebuttal_labels::
