[31mEladynnus: POV issues rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mEladynnus: I've been reading this and other articles relating to the Serer, and the feeling I get is that the information here is being presented to us in a way that suggests that Serer culture is or was far more sophisticated than it actually is. On this page in particular there are several references to and a gallery of pictographs which are apparently indigenous, but the only reference is to phonecia.org, which does not appear to be reliable. Searches on Google and JSTOR turned up nothing. I think that some kind of task force composed of French speakers (not including Tamsier, who has written virtually everything about the Serer on Wikipedia and has an attachment to these articles) investigate the content and tone of it all. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mDrmies: The claim that the French wiki is superior to the English wiki is silly enough, but that this would have something to do with the French nationality is laughable. You're claiming systemic bias in the same breath with which you proclaim that one nationality is superior to another one. As for this article and this tag, I happen to agree with the removal (though your edit summary is, as usual, insulting): I don't see how for instance the images in the article skew its neutrality. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Stating your stance
[31mEladynnus: I could understand if there was little attestation of Raampa on the internet. However, there is none except for the phoenicia.org citation, which itself does not seem to be a trustworthy source (I haven't seen it in citations about any other Phoenician topics) and which makes some very dubious claims about Linear A. I will find the appropriate tag and use it shortly. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mEladynnus: Tamsier, I am somewhat offended by your suggestion that I am automatically biased simply because I speak English and edit pages on the English Wikipedia. I believe that this and related articles suffer from, among other things, an extreme lack of concision and oversight (for example, you are literally the only editor of the Serer topics template and are the author of all the content in many others, which you have marked as top-importance on the Gambian and Senegalese wikiprojects). I have also noticed that you are quick to remove tags which might cast an article's quality or objectivity into doubt. Taken as a whole, this situation smacks of impropriety and it is because of this that I added the tag and suggested that a group of French speaking Wikipedians examine these articles. Please bear in mind that just being aware of systemic bias does not free one from it; this is just as true for you as it is for me. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mTamsier: Hello Eladynnus, I was going to send you a longer reply with diffs but I had a crash so I will make it as short as I can. Not short enough but there you go. Most Serer articles I have created have their corresponding French article which have been gone through by experienced French editor (who are more tougher than English). You are more than welcome to go through my French userpage and all the articles I have listed there and you will find that I have actually invited them to go through them and they have done so (see their edit history). The Raampa thing that you are going on about is actually the work of the anthropologist Moranz because it was available on the net, I thought I made a link to it, but I could have easily cited many scholarly works including those of BIFAN, Gravrand's - "Le Symbolisme sereer  Mythe du Saas et symboles" , etc. The Raampa are Serer religious symbols. Raampa itself is not English, not French, not even Serer-Sine language but a Saafi word from the Cangin group who are ethically Serers. You seem to come here assuming a lot of bad faith but even worst passing judgement on a culture you surely know nothing about. Serer ultra traditionalists care less about Linear A or anything of a sort. The Serer traditionalists are proud of their Black African herigage. They do not look to Egypt, they do not look to Rome or to Arabia via Islam to feel validated. I think you are mistaken the Serer traditionalist with other ethnic groups or other people from other parts of the world. I have never ever met a Serer traditionalist who looks to Egypt or anywhere else. The Serers are proud Serers (Black Africans) not Egyptians or Carthagians, so please don't panic. The Raampa pictographs are religious pictographs rooted in Serer symbolism.  In French Wiki, the Raampa was actually cleaned up and arranged properly after going through the source by an experience French editor from the Saafi article I previously added it in , and here I am giving her credit as I add  it back to the Serer religion article . French Wiki is tougher than English. Unsubstantiate claims or rubbish will be deleted if not tagged as needing citation. As you can see in one of the sentences in Saafi's lead where the editor added a citation needed tag and in her edit summary she says  "sources for the Gambia not found" . Not everything is in google at a click of a mouse or that sources only have to be in English. I suggest you read Wiki sourcing policy. You cannot hold Wikipedia or Serer, Senegambian or any article to ransom by hoping that someone who speaks French will pop-up and do your work for you. I have heard it all before but I have never heard that one in all the time I have been on Wiki. ) With respect, and no offense meant, it is not my problem if you cannot read French. The French language is not my mother togue eiter, but I have to learn it and still learning it (not perfect but ok) so do the same. Now I asked you a question, do you have other reliable sources that substantiate your claim? Or is this just one of those drive-by-tagging and Spider-Man episodes? So that you know, I do not own these  articles. If you find other ways to improve the article with reliable sources, by all means be bold and just do it. Go ahead and improve it. It saves you and me and every body else time. But you cannot hold articles to ransom. I have never head of that. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mEladynnus: Tamsier, what happens at the French Wikipedia is not relevant to this conversation and your repeated assertion that what we produce here is untrustworthy and inferior is not constructive. In addition, your comments about what "ultra traditionalists" think about Raampa suggests that you don't even believe the article you cited is true! You cannot just ignore the parts of a citation that you disagree with. It is for this reason, and the reasons I discussed above, that I feel some kind of oversight is needed. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mTamsier: I am not going to edit war with you over a tag, frankly I do not have the time or patience. I hate edit wars and find them rather distructive to the project. I asked you for sources but you have provided nothing. I am also finding it rather difficult to understand your last comment. It is not making sense like the former. You also came here hoping some French speaking editor would come and do the work for you. You formerly placed the same tag and I removed it even another editor says that your tag was unjustified. Yet, you went and placed the same tag again. My advise is that you read the neutrality policy and Wiki policies in general before placing tags. I have couple of issues for you which you may be able to help me with. You placed the tag on the top which indicates you doubt the neutrality of the whole article or a major part of it. Question  what are you going to do to improve the article? Tagging is the last resort and you have to do something to make it better rather than just tagging. Considering I have told you to be bold and improve the article with RS, you have done nothing so far, you did not even leave an edit summary on your first tag. Since you have an opinion about this article, I would like to know how you are going to improve it? Or must we all be patient and wait until Eladynnus can find a French speaker? No offense, but do you know how ridiculous that sounds? At present, you have done no edit to the article other than trying to force your view on the talk page and plastering tags on the article. Why don't you just be bold and improve it since you clearly have an opinion about this religion? I am not stopping you. I don't own this article or any article on Wiki. If you have ways to improve the article or the project, then by all means just go ahead and do it rather than being disruptive and placing unjustifiable tags just because you can and it is the easiest thing to do. Oh wait! Don't tell me you have never edited an article before? I give you one day and if I do not see any attempt from you to improve the article (the "things" that you take issue with) and remove the tag, I will remove the tag myself. And if you replace the tag I will report you. This project does not need drive-by-taggers. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH0: Name calling/hostility
[31mEladynnus: I am very busy today and don't really have time to explain myself, but I ask you to refer to WP:TIND. I am not a drive-by tagger and you are not in a place to issue ultimatums or reverse edits simply because you disagree with me. Also, contributing to Wikipedia means more than just editing an article - I am drawing attention to what I perceive to be POV and quality issues. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mTamsier: If you believe there is a POV or quality issue, then go ahead and fix it. I have told you that many times. If I see an unref article for instance, I add refs. If I see an error, I fix it. Sure, all articles can be improved but you have made no attempts to improve the article other than placing inappropriate tags to it just because you can. I am not going to waste my time having these meaningless "discussions" with you. I have neither the time nor the inclination. You have a day. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH-1: Bailing out
[34mTamsier: Someone has just placed this article under speedy deletion (an IP user). Somehow, this has never ever happened to this article before until you've showed up and started placing tags. All the editors who contributed to this article so far have tried to improve it in one way or the other, even the ones I have had disagreements with have always provided proposals. What just happened has never happened to this article before until you showed up. Very strange. I've removed the speedy deletion template. I have been assuming lots of good faith but vandalising Wiki articles is not a nice thing to do. I 've also removed your tags. If you are really interested in improving the article (since you have an opinion about it) go ahead and improve. You do not need to tag it. I will be filing a report if this continues. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mEladynnus: Please call this to the administrators' attention, I've been saying for days now that that is needed. Tags are not vandalism (except maybe deletion tags placed on an article by a never-before-seen IP editor - good thing you were there to undo it a few minutes later!), and it is improper to remove tags as quickly as you do in these Serer articles, and especially without saying so in your edit summary as you did in this most recent edit here, instead only saying that you have reverted vandalism. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mTamsier: Although I could have been more detailed in my edit summary (I give you that), I did so in my edit summary and made reference to here . What I find strange is that, this has never ever happened before. Inspite of all the previous disagreements, which were finally all settled amicably by all the major previous editors on this article, such a thing has never ever happened before until now. I have great respect for many of those former editors including Halaqah (who in the end we finally made our peace and got on). I have also expressed my respect for Halaqah on their talk page and elsewhere in spite of all the previous disagreements. I am sure if he was here he would be just as disappointed at just what happened. This has never ever happened before until now. Very strange. Looking at the IPs contribution, it looks like it was specifically directed to this article because I could find no contribution log as of todate where they have "contributed" to another article apart from this one IP 70.94.83.11 @ on Serer religion. I have looked into Whois and here are the IP's details. I think admin would be able to do a comparison analysis to find out which computer it came from and whether a registered editor also uses that computer. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mEladynnus: Tamsier, I ask you once again to cease removing the tags on this article. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
