[31mJytdog: presidential campaign of transhumanist candidate rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mJytdog: this is one of the most WP:OFFTOPIC, WP:COATRACK edits i have ever seen in Wikipedia. reverted. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mHaptic-feedback: I apologize if the information is off-topic. I honestly thought that it was on topic, since the candidate's main issue seems to be transhumanism with a heavy focus on life extension. Will you help me understand why this is irrelevant?
Also, I did not mean to detract the section from the politics of life extension. Is there a way that I can reword this information so that it does not make the article seem like a "coatrack"? rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mRonz: Seems undue and well into WP:SOAP territory. If something comes of it in the future we should add it as a part of whatever makes it noteworthy. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mHaptic-feedback: Does just one sentence really count as undue? The information has already received significant media attention, and it is displayed on other parts of Wikipedia. At what point will it count as having something come of it for the purposes of this page, and how is that decision made?
Also, it is a just factual statement that does not advocate anything, influence attitudes about something, recruit anyone, display opinion, gossip about scandal, promote myself, try to sell something, or act on behalf of an organization. Given this, I do not see how your linked policy is relevant. Can you explain? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mRonz: Yes, one sentence can be undue. He's definitely using the topic to promote himself and his interests. Further, politics is often used for cheap pr purposes. Given the nature of the sources, their content, and the history of political campaigning being used solely for promotional purposes, I think it falls well into SOAP. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mRonz: it is a just factual statement: Nothing is just a factual statement. Everything we include in our articles falls under NPOV. Some information just isn't noteworthy, some barely so. Some information serves purposes that contradict the goals and interests of this encyclopedia. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mHaptic-feedback: I suspect that everyone campaigning for political office promotes themselves and their interests to some degree. However, I do not think that he is using life extension to promote himself as much as he is using himself to promote life extension. Regardless, "WP:SOAP" does not apply to Istvan's words off of Wikipedia. Actually, it does not apply here at all, because ''the content that I added'' does not violate this policy, as ''the content itself'' is not advocacy, propaganda, recruitment, et cetera. In fact, according to the policy, an article "can report objectively ''about'' such things, as long as an attempt is made to describe the topic from a neutral point of view", which is precisely what my content did. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mHaptic-feedback: What I meant by it being a "factual statement" is that it is either true or false and does not express opinion. The real contention here seems to be about whether the content has a neutral point of view. Since it does not express a viewpoint, the only relevant part of Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy that I noticed is the small section on balancing aspects, which says to "strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to the weight of that aspect in the body of reliable sources on the subject." Let us then review the body of sources about the presidential campaign:
're:form''
'ExtremeTech''
'National Review''
'Business Insider''
'Wired''
'The Telegraph''
'Heise Online''
'Reason''
Roland Benedikter in ''The Leftist Review''
'Humanity+''
'Psychology Today''
'Motherboard''
'The Huffington Post''
'Gizmodo''
'Popular Science''
'Esquire''
'Stanford Political Journal''
Is this enough for one sentence? I suspect that there is other information on the life extension page that does not have this much coverage. Of course, some of the authors of the above sources are biased, but they are still reliable for this information, which is not an opinion or contentious claim. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mRonz: Thanks for all the potential refs. I don't have time atm to go through them all. If we put aside for now the interviews, puff-pieces, and human interest stories, what do we have left? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mJytdog: ''no'''. the presidential candidacy has '''nothing''' to do with the subject of life extension outside of POV-pushing for a Transhumanist agenda. Stop abusing WP as a WP:SOAPBOX. It is a bad thing to do. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mRonz: '(edit conflict)'' Of those left from my question, which of them discuss life extension, the topic of this article, in any degree of detail? If none, then it's probably not worth mention. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mHaptic-feedback: There are articles that include interviews in that list, but they are not ''only'' interviews: they also include reliable background information. I did not notice any exaggerated praise in any of the articles, so I did not see any puff pieces. Also, I did not notice any of them describing Istvan in a way to bring sympathy to him or inspiration from him, so I do not think that any are human interest stories. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mHaptic-feedback: Regardless of the motives, the fact that life extension is one of the main issues of an American presidential candidate is clearly relevant to life extension. Since all I did was mention this fact, free of advocacy or opinion, I do not understand how I violated the soapbox policy. Can you please quote which part I violated? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mHaptic-feedback: Excluding any interviews within the articles, 12 or 13 out of 17 mention life extension. The weight of the link between the candidacy and life extension looks clear to me. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mHaptic-feedback: I have never advocated transhumanism on Wikipedia. Making neutral statements about a topic is not advocacy. Please let me give you a friendly reminder to be polite, assume good faith, and avoid personal attacks. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH4: Stating your stance
[32mHaptic-feedback: Anyway, whether or not a person is popular, a simple sentence about their political emphasis on life extension is of course pertinent to a section on the politics of life extension, given that it is written in a neutral point of view and backed by several reliable sources. I see that the article is largely about science, but there are also many sections about other aspects of life extension, such as public opinion, the history of its movement, and ethics regarding it. If you want to move these to their own article, then I would probably support you. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mHaptic-feedback: I never claimed that the candidate is affecting the race, so there is no need for a source saying this. Most things on Wikipedia do not have a source like the New York Times, so that standard is obviously too high â€“ a plethora of other reliable sources such as the list above should do. Actually, mention of the Transhumanist Party, its candidate, and its policies (including life extension) are already on Wikipedia. Why, then, should one small remark about them not be here, too? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mHaptic-feedback: I am sorry to hear that you are choosing ignorance over discussion. However, since you refuse to listen to me on this topic or discuss why I am wrong, then I hope you will not try to revert any similar edits in the future. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mJytdog: If you are such intense advocate for trashumanism that you cannot see that mention of a FRINGE political candidate in an article about the science around extending life is completely UNDUE, you probably should not be editing Wikipedia.  You need to check your ideology at the WP log in page.  I am going to ignore further discussion of this until you bring a source like NYT that gives substantial discussion to this.  That source will need to show that the candidate is actually affecting the race and that life extension is one of the key reasons why. Otherwise this is a complete waste of time. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mJytdog: My comments above are based on your continuing to insist that this content should be in this article at this time. Continuing. Zoltan himself says "We've got another 14 months to go before we have to concede or something like that. Of course, I stand almost no chance of winning the 2016. But, I have been working, and I discussed this with my wife before I even started the campaign, that the real goal is to try to work and build the Transhumanist Party so that it has a much better shot at 2020 and 2024."  Wikipedia is not a place to build the party. rebuttal_labels:: DH7: Refuting the central point
[34mRonz: If none of the proposed sources discusses life extension in any depth, then we've little or no context from which to determine what would be appropriate due weight. Balancing that against he SOAP problems, I think there's a good case for keeping it out. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mHaptic-feedback: I completely agree. We should keep political recruitment off of Wikipedia. Let us keep all content about politics neutral, as my edit was. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mJytdog: nobody but an advocate for transhumanist politics would think this FRINGE political campaign worthy of mention in this article about health. you ''are'' the one introducing politics. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mHaptic-feedback: There are no "SOAP" problems here. The policy actually explicitly allows neutral comments about advocacy and recruitment, such as my own. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mHaptic-feedback: Regarding weight, the sources do discuss life extension at depth. Let me give you some quotes.
The piece from ''The Telegraph'' has a lengthy paragraph on just life extension:
The discussion with political analyst Roland Benedikter in the ''Heise Online'' article is difficult for me to parse, because I cannot read German, though he seems to talk about life extension multiple times. However, his interview in ''Leftist Review'' is in English. In that article, he identifies "three important developmental steps, that some consider milestones on the way to 'transhumanism'". The first, he says, is Google's Calico project. He has this to say:
The second identified step is the United States's BRAIN initiative. The third, he says, is Istvan's Transhumanist Party. Benedikter states:
It admittedly takes a bit of synthesis to connect Istvan's party to Calico's mission, but combining this information with that of the other sources makes the link clear.
The ''Popular Science'' states this:
More depth is reached in the interviews with Istvan. I agree that less weight should be given to his words, but they are not weightless, as the interviews are conducted and curated by professional journalists and published in reliable publications under editorial oversight â€“ the staff choose what to publish. Even articles by Istvan him should be considered, because (for better or for worse) they still drive public awareness and conversation.
Is this not enough for one mention in passing? rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mHaptic-feedback: My character is irrelevant, because I am not advocating politics on Wikipedia. Please refrain from ''ad hominem'' attacks. Let me quote Wikipedia's "no personal attacks" policy: rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mHaptic-feedback: I only introduced politics insofar as neutrally mentioning political subjects, which is explicitly allowed in Wikipedia's soapbox policy. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mJytdog: I completely understand why you are saying that. I work on Conflict of interest and advocacy issues across Wikipedia, and I understand why you are saying that.  But what you are not hearing, is that your advocacy is causing a problem here. I will take this up with you further on your talk page, which is indeed a more appropriate venue. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mHaptic-feedback: Again, I have never advocated politics or transhumanism on Wikipedia. The only thing that I am advocating here is adherence to Wikipedia's guidelines, which your comments have breached but not mine. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
