{'text': 'I am new to wikipedia so please bear with me if this is not the correct place to discuss this. I appear the a photo towards the bottom of this article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lady_Thatcher_at_dinner_2008_crop.jpg) and I would really like the photo to be removed or replaced by another. First, the caption reads "Thatcher surrounded by Young Conservatives" and I am not and have never been a Conservative. I was actually at the event to help out my friend\'s parents and didn\'t realise it was a Conservative event prior to turning up. Second, I am actually looking for a job in progressive politics and this may really impede my efforts. Third, I never consented to my photo being used in this way. I realise that you cannot totally manage the way that your image is used on the internet but I would really like this to be rectified. The photo does not actually add any great substance to the article so perhaps a different photo from the same Author could be used instead. I checked and there are some that are just as good. I would obviously change it myself if I could but the article is semi-protected.', 'username': 'Ogwikitem', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Other']}

{'text': 'You could try raising this matter on the picture talkpage here. However i am unsure if there is anything that can be done, had you been a conservative and changed your mind and now become a liberal, the image would still be accurate. The fact that the sash says conservatives does back up the description. However the description of the picture on this article could be changed to the description of the photo on its file page which is "Lady Thatcher at a conservative dinner in London, UK."   The picture certainly does not need to be removed, but depending on how others feel the rewording to be in line with the original description the image was uploaded with might be a compromise. But im certainly not convinced the change is needed,', 'username': 'BritishWatcher', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Suggesting a compromise', 'Coordinating edits']}
{'text': 'OK, so I suppose the series of events are quite implausible, and I could just be lying about the "not being a Conservative" thing. The whole situation was pretty awkward and with hindsight I should have acted differently. But I was young and didn\'t want to be rude or rock the boat. However, the caption makes a factual claim about Thatcher being surrounded by young Conservatives. Now, being a Young Conservative requires membership and I\'m sure that the fact I was not a young Conservative can be verified by checking some records. That would be much more accurate than inferring from the photo, especially given that I am now saying that I was (and am) not. Like I said, I\'m not clued up on how these things work and I wanted to check on here to see what, if anything, can be done. I\'m happy to compromise and I really don\'t wan\'t annoy anyone.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •', 'username': 'Ogwikitem', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH4: Repeated argument'], 'coordination_labels': ['Providing clarification']}
{'text': 'I have changed the caption to reflect the description of the image when it was initially uploaded. So it now is more accurate and does not state that everyone in the image is a conservative. With the caption now changed, im not entirely sure what else can be done. I see no justification for removing the picture all together. However it might be worth asking at Wikipedia:Help desk on if there is a way for you to request the image be deleted due to you being in it.
