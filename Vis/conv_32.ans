[31mDjm-leighpark: Climate Edit War rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mDjm-leighpark: I am not totally sure who is right or wrong but we need a concensus here.  It isn't going to happen in one line edit descriptions.
A revision with it in is here.
I have currently removed it.  This does not mean I am for or against it, I might be marginally in favour but I'd like to see the arguments for and against.  I think everyone is trying to act in good faith.
I see how discussion is going in a couple of days time
Thankyou. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mDjm-leighpark: Adding a few notes:
This article is under WikiProject UK geography (amongst others) with Wikipedia:WikiProject UK geography/How to write about settlements#Geography relevant
A list of (current) weather stations here [].  The nearest to Selsey is Bognor.  Guidence seems to be to use Template:Climate chart (however use of Template:Weather box seems quite prevalent.
From a quick glance round the practice for local coastal resorts without a weather stations does appear to be not to published climate tables. Worthing is a similar 'B-Class' article with an approach similar to that for Selsey (without the climate table).
The climate data will usually be available at the next regional level up (usually county), in this case West Sussex, though Hampshire takes a different (possible better) approach showing a spread of results from weather stations.  Interestingly the 'See also' goes to the UK climate article skipping the county section article.
The case for the climate tables are that visitors intending to Holiday to Selsey and checking Wikipedia might be interested in the climate data
I believe the climate table contributor would indicate the data is properly sourced on the basis of the 5km grid data published from the Met Office.  I have only a hazy understanding of how this works but is apparently interpolates between weather stations and is supplemented by other sources and they are fairly confident most spurious readings have been eliminated. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mDjm-leighpark: My though is longer term not automated manual maintenance of such climate tables is probably unsustainable.
Overviewing these points I conclude on balance the climate data should not be included for Selsey but I am open to other arguments. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mCharlesdrakew: I my experiance consensus is that covering climate is best done at county level. Unless there is an official weather station in the settlement the data is going to be extrapolated and not verifiable in such fine detail. Local factors can not be factored in with certainty. Such a mass of detail is probably undue for an encyclopedia article on a settlement. If we use anything I would favour the climate chart because it conveys sufficient information for the average reader in an easily digestible form.
There is also the question of original research as the data is copied from a primary source database, and one that requires login.
As to informing visitors Wikipedia is not a travel guide. We have Wikivoyage for that function, and that can be linked to. In this country the weather we actually get has little relation to averages anyway. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mWilfridselsey: The main climate points about Selsey is that it is in the sunniest part of the UK and  in a tornado hotspot ('The Isle of Wight and South Coast Anomaly'), the article now provides that information. The citations include links to quite comprehensive Met office  climate tables for Selsey. The weather detail on the West Sussex page is quite limited, hence the See Also to the UK Climate page.  I think the section now works with or without the climate tables. But as you say, the problem with climate tables is that they have to be manually updated. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mSovalValtos: The current version without a weather box seems to be going in the right direction by using text and cited sources. One advantage of Wikipedia is the ease of linking information. Just because the Met Office do a synthesis of data does not mean we need to use it in all settlements a few miles apart giving it undue weight. Wikilink(s) to the appropriate regional level or nearest weather station site article would hit the mark. Introducing material with an unsustainable maintenance requirement does not seem a good idea. Incidently would it not be better to have the climate content as part of a Geography section? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[35m10 December 2017: I am open to having a discussion about the weather box. What I do not agree is that the weather box must not be included until we reach a consensus. I added the data back in the Autumn and added the record highs and lows in the following months, until recently all of that data has gone unchallenged. Soon as the weather box was there before this dispute had begun, then arguably it should remain in place until we reach a consensus. The primary reason I added the weather box was because Selsey is located in the sunniest grid square of the UK according to the Met Office. So because of this, a climate chart will not do as it does not display the sunshine hours. Selsey does not have significantly different weather to most other parts of the UK with the exception of its sunshine totals. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35m10 December 2017: I also do not agree that weather boxes bear little resemblance to the actual weather conditions. Most likely this is used as a cover up to claim things like there are ''more sunny days in the winter'' or ''the south coast of England is not sunny in the summer'', both of which are undisputedly false. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mDjm-leighpark: Given content arguments so far I'd recommend removal of weather box and move climate section to subsection of geography.  I am personnally not undoing that last edit (821130566) at the moment to avoid warring. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mDjm-leighpark: I am beginning to think concensus is unlikely to be reached.  And there have been no updates in 24 hour to that revert re-inserting climate data with a weatherbox the which is not in my opinion consistent with WikiProject UK geography/How to write about settlements#Geography.   Unless someone feels confident to back the weatherbox out we will need to go to Wikipedia:Dispute resolution / WP:Wikipedia:Dispute resolution requests which gives a number of directions and I would appreciate comments on which way to go. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
