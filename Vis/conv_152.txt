{'text': 'Let me just ask you one final thing, did you actually read the sources? I\'m not disputing the reliability of the sources. What I am disputing is the claim that you and  believe they have based on their click bait title. Also, it\'s not against policy to remove sources if those sources don\'t actually back what\'s claimed. I will quote these articles:\nFrom Sky Sports reference\nWWE powerhouse Big Show has \'\'\'\'\'continued to tease\'\'\'\'\' a WrestleMania showdown with basketball legend Shaquille O\'Neal\nShow\'s tweet \'\'\'\'\'suggests\'\'\'\'\' the bout will take place on April 2 in Orlando\nFrom Fox Sports reference\nbut one of the bouts has been \'\'\'\'\'tentatively\'\'\'\'\' on the card since the ESPYs last summer.\nEverything else in the articles are information about the two, their past encounters, Shaq "accepting" the match (which isn\'t an automatic guarantee), the back and forth tweets, and speculation. No where in those articles does it confirm that the match is happening.\nAlso, to follow up on Fox Sports breaking the news about Teddy\'s Hall of Fame induction first, I can use that exact argument against you. Every time that another news outlet other than WWE has reported something first, WWE soon after posted about it and mentioned it on TV. They have done neither in regards to this match. They have only teased the possibility of it. As I said in an earlier post, I know the match is gonna happen. It\'s why I\'ve added information to the hidden paragraph in the Background section, however, I know that we don\'t put information unless it\'s confirmed.', 'username': 'JDC808', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}

Now you just admitted you know the match is happening which is why you hid the storyline in the article. It should be removed as well hidden or not, Typical double standard bs.
