{'text': "Nicola Schneider's Master's thesis of 2007 (written in Italian) sheds new light on the provenance of the ''Adagio''. It doesn't offer a final answer, but it shows that Giazotto did use some kind of source. The following is an edited Google translation of the relevant passage (Nicola Schneider: ''La tradizione delle opere di Tomaso Albinoni a Dresda'', tesi di laurea specialistica, Facoltà di musicologia dell'Università degli studi di Pavia, Cremona 2007, pp. 181–186; footnotes are from the original, additions by me are in small type and {curly brackets}):\n{{quotation|But there is another version of the origin of the ''Adagio'', supplied by the same Giazotto, which differs considerably from that of 1958. According to the friendly communication by Remo Giazotto's last assistant and academic collaborator, Dr. Muska Mangano (Verona), the aged musicologist, near death, explained the genesis of the ''Adagio'' again, prompted by an article by Piero Buscaroli {published on 22 September 1992}. The following is Muska Mangano's letter:\nAccording to this testimony, Giazotto received the fragments of the ''Adagio'' at the very beginning of the war without giving notice in his monograph published later.Perhaps because of scruples about the authenticity of the fragment? The discrepancy between the six and the four bars of the first violin mentioned in the versions of 1958 and 1992 respectively should certainly not be taken literally because at that time Giazotto was already very ill. Questions addressed to his heirs about the existence of material relating to his book left in their possession have not produced any results so far, therefore the allegations reported are not verifiable. But shortly before Giazotto's death, Muska Mangano undertook to finish his work on Clementi,Clementi 2002 {= Muzio Clementi: ''Epistolario 1781–1831.'' A cura di Remo Giazotto. Skira, Milan 2002}. and among his papers she found related studies and notes, including a modern photocopy of the fragment that had been the source of the ''Adagio'' in the edition of 1958. {...} The appearance of this document in Muska Mangano's possession must be considered an important fact since that copy is the only foothold of the original Dresden source.\nThe paper is a recent photocopy of a modern manuscript bearing in the top right-hand corner a stamp stating unequivocally the Dresden provenance of the original from which it was taken. Since, unfortunately, it is not a frame like those that constituted Giazotto's research material, namely positive images with writing in white on a black background (as seen reproduced in the monograph of 1945), it is difficult to evaluate this document. It should be noted immediately that the copy does not reproduce the basso continuo in print of which one has read many times, but its manual transcription in a handwriting that appears to belong to the first half of the twentieth century. The transcriber was evidently German – as indicated by the title {Albinoni’s Trio Sonate G moll} – and wrote down the entire figured bass, inserting the six fragmentary bars of the first violin in their place on the staves. Unfortunately, the photocopy has cut up the writing on the stamp, which thus is not decipherable, but it should be reconstructible by comparison with similar contemporary documents; the words may have contained the name either of the photo studio or of the library that is running the photograph. You can read very well the words below: “Dresden. – Lichtbild | von”. It is unclear what the doubly underlined number “7” refers to, which is located directly below the stamp; it could possibly refer to the number of bars (77 without the 'soli' in bb. 20/21), but this would be an unusual position for a number – at the top and not at the end of the piece. In any case it cannot be the beginning of a signature because in the Dresden system introduced in the years 1926–30 signatures begin with the word 'Mus.' followed by the composer's identification number (Albinoni, in this case, was given the “2199”).\nApparently, a manuscript copy of the printed source was first drawn up in Dresden, in which the melodic fragments of the first violin were then inserted, and from this manuscript the photograph was taken that came to Giazotto. From some source, however, he must have heard about the printed bass part he mentions several times. It is not clear why the Dresden library did not send a frame or a microfilm of this printed part, as they did for all the other sources. When Giazotto sold all the photographic material relating to his work on Albinoni in 1940, he could not foresee what turn the war would take. At that time, the scope of devastation the British fleet would cause in the German city shortly thereafter was unimaginable for all, which is why, perhaps, Giazotto could not calculate the value of his collection of microfilm, which preserved, at least in content, many sources that are no longer available because they burned or were dispersed.E.g. that of the concerto for violin and orchestra Co 3 held at D-Dl, Mus. 2-O-1.\nTalbot and many others have “disattributed” the ''Adagio'' to Albinoni – remember that Giazotto never claimed that the piece was all original – on purely stylistic grounds. The stylistic categories to determine the authenticity of the ''Adagio'' should be applied, if anything, only to the figured bass. To facilitate a comparison of the score in Giazotto's edition, the basso continuo attested by the Dresden copy and the authentic trio sonatasThe op. I and the six sonatas So 20–25. by Albinoni, there will be a diplomatic transcription of the page of music at the end of this chapter. When he began to elaborate the figured bass, Giazotto was perhaps mindful of the example of Nikolaus Heinrich Gerber, who under the auspices of Johann Sebastian Bach had worked out an accompaniment on the figured bass of the sonata Op. VI, 6, which Spitta reprinted in the appendix to his work on Bach.Giazotto 1945, p. 84, was aware of it. A comparison of Muska Mangano's copy and the Ricordi score reveals that the bass without the figures in Giazotto's score can be found almost unchanged in the left hand of the organ. One notices slight rhythmic variations in support of the new melody and some advances designed to emphasize the essentially “romantic” character of Giazotto's piece. The original melodic fragments of the first violin are not marked as such, while many expressive and agogic indications (which at that time were not a rarity even in historical-critical editions – think of Malipiero's editorial practices) are by the modern author. The harmonic progress required by the original figures is largely respected, even if the high concentration of 9–8 suspensions, which creates a highly pathetic atmosphere, has no equivalent in the genuine trio sonatas by Albinoni.", 'username': 'Schneid9', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Providing clarification']}

{'text': 'I think we must beware of two extremes: (1) dismissing the \'\'Adagio\'\' as a pure hoax, (2) considering the Mangano discovery as solid proof of the authenticity of the fragments.\n(1) Giazotto never claimed that the \'\'Adagio\'\' was all Albinonian. The original preface clearly states that it was "composed" by Giazotto on the basis of a printed figured bass and 6 bars of the first violin, and the cover of the Ricordi edition gives Giazotto\'s name in much larger print than Albinoni\'s. Still, the preface calls the work a "reconstruction", which probably suggested a greater degree of authenticity than was actually warranted, so that later editions and arrangements sometimes omitted Giazotto\'s name altogether (e.g. , , , , , , ). And, of course, the fact that the \'\'Adagio\'\' was often recorded together with real Albinoni works also contributed to the general impression that it was authentic (a few examples from the past: I Musici, Karl Ristenpart, Alain Boulfroy, Jean Witold; more recent ones: , , ).\n(2) As R.D.Tennent said above, Nicola Schneider neither claims nor believes that the sheet of music discovered by Muska Mangano among Giazotto\'s papers is an 18th century manuscript or even an Albinoni autograph. Instead, he places it in the first half of the 20th century (because of the handwriting) and in Germany (because of the German title "Albinoni\'s, Trio Sonate G. moll" and the fragmentary stamp "Dresden. Lichtbild von"  [= Dresden. Photograph by]). If this interpretation is correct (and I see no reason why it shouldn\'t, except perhaps for the rather awkward spelling of the title – "Albinonis Triosonate G-Moll" would have been more normal), it might be defensible to conclude that Giazotto did base his \'\'Adagio\'\' on a source, though we still don\'t know (a) who wrote the manuscript, (b) if the manuscript was held by a Dresden library or if it was only photographed in Dresden (the Saxon State Library may well have been right in their denial that the manuscript had ever been in their possession!), (c) if Albinoni was the composer. What I don\'t believe is that the manuscript was based on Giazotto\'s score: The only person who would have had a reason to do so was Giazotto himself (because he was constantly bothered about his source), so if he really made such a masterful forgery (including the idiosyncratic stamp!), why didn\'t he produce it during his lifetime? Or does anybody think his assistant Muska Mangano made it to restore Giazotto\'s good reputation? Then why did she give it to a student of music for his unpublished Master\'s thesis instead of making it available to the general public?', 'username': 'Schneid9', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Providing clarification']}
