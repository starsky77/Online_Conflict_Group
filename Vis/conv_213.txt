{'text': 'First of all, what are your references (with pages)? You did not answer this question. Even if there are RS telling that the compound used to poison Kivelidi was "Substance 33", that content still belongs to this page for three reasons: a) The substance 33 is in fact "Novichok" compound according to this (see citation below), (b) there is a significant number of other RS telling it was Novichok:', 'username': 'My very best wishes', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'Sources for what? Mirzayanov stating that VR was used to kill Kivelidi— Zabarin—. There are no reliable sources stating that it was Novichok. You are linking sources that state only that it was a nerve agent. VR \'\'is\'\' a nerve agent. It thus belongs on the VR article \'\'\'not\'\'\' the Novichok article. Don\'t ask for sources - I have provided a source (Mirzayanov, above) confirming it was Substance 33, while all you are doing is providing sources that speculate or just say "nerve agent". I\'m well aware of what you are trying to do here, introducing dubious misinformation and speculation to muddy the waters. You have not refuted Mirzayanov\'s reliability, his close knowledge of the Foliant program and Substance 33, and you are conflating VR - a different agent \'\'with its own article\'\' - with the Novichok agents. Tucker above is quite clearly being misquoted or is simply wrong: "the first binary formulation developed under Foliant was used to make Substance 33" is nonsense because Substance 33 is a \'\'unitary\'\' agent and was developed by 1963. Substance 33 is not a Novichok agent - it is VR! The reason they are called "novichok" is because they are the new generation \'\'after\'\' the \'\'V\'\' agents!', 'username': 'Neil S Walker', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation', 'DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument'], 'coordination_labels': []}

{'text': 'I think we are coming to the following conclusion. This is a series of compounds. All compounds in the Table on the top (binary or not) should be mentioned on this page and relevant to this page because: (a) they are closely related to the development and disclosure of Novichok, and (b) they were frequently named in multiple sourced simply as "Novichok". Even Mirzayanov tells here something like "substance 33 aka "Novichok" ("Для его убийства было использовано вещество-33, так, по крайней мере, говорилось в то время, дескать использовался "Новичок".

{'text': 'As about Khattab, - who knows?, but I am thinking about Moscow hostage crisis chemical agent. That was quite obviously not an opioid, but a nerve agent, possibly in a mixture with something and at a low dose. All signs are there: the high mortality rate, the long-term significant health damage for victims, people stopped breathing, and the operation had to be personally approved by Putin as he recently admitted.', 'username': 'My very best wishes', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
{'text': "I think we can be fairly sure the Moscow Theatre agent was an opioid, forensic analysis of clothes and urine of survivors found carfentanil, remifentanil and halothane. Besides the symptoms do not match nerve agent, true both opioid and nerve agent toxicity cause miosis, vomiting and cessation of breathing, but nerve agents also characteristically produce violent convulsions and production of mucus, which were not evident in victims from that incident. Khattab seems more likely, it is acknowledged that he was poisoned with an unknown nerve agent, and by some accounts with a delayed onset then sudden emergence of effects, like what was seen with the Skripals. But given the circumstances of Khattab's death it seems unlikely the truth will ever be known.   But\nYes, they found what they found , but no one can guarantee they found everything. People who survived became handicaps for life. Here is one of publications on this. According to another RS, 40 people died during six months after the application of the agent. Does it look like an effect of opioid drugs? Moreover, witnesses claimed it was gas, not aerosol.", 'username': 'Meodipt', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Providing clarification']}
{'text': 'Note that Russian article from yesterday includes what purports to be evidence from the trial showing the compound that killed Kivelidi to be the F > OEt analogue of GV, not Substance 33.
