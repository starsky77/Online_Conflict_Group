[31mTryptofish: 12 rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mTryptofish: OK, time to start a new number! Trying to take into account the talk above, and being a glutton for punishment, I offer version '''12'''. What I've tried to do is to take into account what people did and did not like about '''11d''' and '''radical-b''', and combine them: rebuttal_labels::

[34mBorn2cycle: Bravo! rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mJimWae: 1> As I have commented many times before: "lack" implies a deficiency 2>This construction has wikipedia take a position that the absence definition is a good "definition" of atheism. Doing so would violate WP:NPOV. Accordingly, per WP:BRD, I will be reverting your edit to the earlier one that I also dislike. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mCybercobra: By implication, you're saying the absence definition is a bad "definition" of atheism, which is equally POV. At any rate, these threads have gotten so convoluted that I'll admit I've lost track of exactly what beefs people had with the original lede. There seems to be quite a lot of bikeshedding going on. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mCybercobra: Ah, right, the "dictionary-ness". The point of this new draft is to try and summarize the three definitions in a pithy way, succinctly, and in a single sentence; and then present the 3 more detailed definitions directly thereafter. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mJimWae: It is not just my opinion that the absence def is deficient as a def. Nagel explicitly opposes it, and Dawkins implicitly - even the source we use says it is less rigorous (there are other reasons why that source was used - so don't change the source). Numerous other sources also oppose the absence def. I am not advocating that we say it is substandard, but the construction you reverted to endorses it. WP:BRD advises against the revert you made before further discussion has taken place - and when the issue is the WP:NPOV policy, lots of discussion is needed. The fix is to say "Atheism ''has been defined as''..." (a1 & a2 & a3). rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mCybercobra: That's not gonna fly. The "that sounds like a dictionary" contingent won't have it. (Not that I'm part of said contingent). rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mJimWae: According to all responses to the RFC I started at the talk page for WP:NAD, there is no problem in saying "A has been defined as..."(a1 and a2 and a3). So the concern about "sounds like a dictionary" is just a local style sentiment (or just a misinterpretation of WP:NAD) - not a style guideline issue. Policy issues - especially NPOV policy - override local style sentiments (and even style guideline issues). rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mJimWae: It is also POV to say "'''Atheism''' ''is'' the position that there are no deities" as there are 3 defs and no agreement that any one of them is what atheism "really is". rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mWindyhead: Agree, feel free to revert to consensus lead rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mJimWae: I'd rather you used one of your reverts for that. I've already reverted today, 1.7 times) rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mBorn2cycle: I apologize if I missed it, but I see no objection above to this version (thanks to CyberCobra for wordsmithing this one): rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mBorn2cycle: Atheism is disbelief or absence of belief in the existence of deities, including the position that there are no deities,[1] the rejection of belief in the existence of deities,[2] or simply the absence of belief that any deities exist.[3]
However, it was reverted twice, once without explanation, and a second time with the "no consensus" non-objection.  In fact, this is a wording that has addressed all stated concerns on this talk page, which is quite the feat.  So, I've restored it.  Please, if you have an objection to any wording, make it specific on the talk page.  Thanks. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mBorn2cycle: And I understand that there are objections to the "absence of belief" definition, however, it is a definition used in reliable sources, and is clearly qualified with ''or'', making clear it is not the only definition used in reliable sources.  Disbelief is listed first, making clear that is no way is the absence being endorsed as ''the'' definition (a much more valid objection made earlier to saying simply "Atheism is nonbelief in ..."). rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mTryptofish: I think "disbelief or absence of belief" is good, and arguably better than "unbelief or disbelief", although I don't think there's a big difference. I think "lack of" is a problem. And I think edit warring instead of discussing here is a bigger problem. Shall I, once again, request full protection? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mTryptofish: By the way, deity is now blue-linked three times in the one sentence. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mBorn2cycle: Wikipedia is not improved by tolerance for reverts made without explanation, include reverts made with pseudo objections like "insufficient discussion" or "no consensus".  Especially considering all the work going into this, people should at least have the decency to clearly explain their actual objection (if any) to a given version before reverting it, if they revert it at all.  Anything but reverting such a revert amounts to tolerance of such behavior, and is not good for Wikipedia. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mBorn2cycle: Please fix the links! rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mBorn2cycle: T, I agree with your comments about content. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mCybercobra: Overlinkage fixed. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mTryptofish: Thank you, but: ''Gripes about the links'': it used to be useful, and consensus, to have links to God and gods somewhere in the lead. And the theism thing, although well-intentioned, has the effect of seeming to say that theism is an example of existence of God. rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[31mTryptofish: And while I'm at it (griping), I think the claim that the lead is POV is nonsense. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mBorn2cycle: Regardless of whether it is nonsense, what I don't see is an explanation from Jim (who marked it as violation NPOV) or anyone else about why he or anyone else believes it to be a violation of NPOV.  Without such explanation, the tag needs to be removed. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[33mDannyno: When I suggested "disbelief or unbelief", I thought the form of words had the advantage of being ambiguous, so that the next sentence could set out our three main typological traditions and we didn't need to get bogged down in POV issues with the very first sentence.  It is not clear to me that "absence of belief" is not tolerably contained in the dictionary definitions of either "disbelief" or "unbelief".  The proposal mentions "absence" in the next sentence, so to mention it in the very first sentence seems to give it more weight as compared with anything else.   I would be interested in reading why people think "absence" ought to appear up front. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mTryptofish: You make some good points there. Putting "absence" up front makes it a repetition of what comes so soon after in "definition 3". What you refer to as ambiguity can also be regarded as generality and inclusiveness. And, on a separate point, I want to observe that there has been insufficient discussion of the changes to the blue links in the lead. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH5: Counterargument
