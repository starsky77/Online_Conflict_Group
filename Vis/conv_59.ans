[31mScjessey: From the horse's mouth rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mScjessey: Sanford (Sandy) Newman writes in the ''Wall Street Journal'' (July 22, 2008):
John Fund's "Obama's Liberal Shock Troops" (op-ed, July 12) has some facts wrong. The historic nonpartisan drive to increase voter participation that Barack Obama led in 1992 wasn't for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, but for Project Vote  of which I was the national director in 1992.
Instead of accepting far more prestigious and better paying offers, Mr. Obama accepted a grueling job with Project Vote for a meager salary. He believed so much in the democratic process that he even gave up the contract for publication of his book, not knowing whether he would ever find another publisher. He brought a broad spectrum of community organizations into that effort, conducting what remains the most successful nonpartisan voter drive in Illinois history.
Project Vote remains a separate organization today. Indeed, it wasn't until after Mr. Obama's tenure had ended that it began to conduct projects more frequently with Acorn than with other community-based organizations.
Both Project Vote and Acorn should be proud that their efforts have increased voting. Acorn should also be proud of its other work, including winning minimum-wage increases and helping lead the fight against predatory lending and unfair foreclosures.
Mr. Obama's willingness to sacrifice because of his deep commitment to strengthening the democratic process is something that all Americans should applaud regardless of their party or politics.

Obviously this is a primary source, so secondary sources are still desired (and required) to guarantee accuracy; nevertheless, I think we can safely say that the "arm" nonsense can be dropped for good. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mArzel: This is nothing more than Newman coming to the defense of Obama and provide damage control, when this isn't even about Obama and there isn't even any damage to control.  I particularly like how he praises ACORN and PV, yet only writes in to say that Obama has no connection to ACORN.  I swear, the more people try to say there is no connection, the more clear it is that there is a connection. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mScjessey: Which part of "Project Vote remains a separate organization today" do you not understand? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mBdell555: What part of "Project Vote is an arm of ACORN" don't YOU understand?  You dismiss sources like the National Review as partisan, yet don't consider this source as similarly tainted by partisanship?  I noticed that in today's NY Times, the paper felt it necessary to print a correction that "Can‚Äôt Take My Eyes Off of You‚Äù should not have included an "of" before "You".  Such is the attention to accuracy in details.  In any case, I have no objection to the article stating that although Project Vote is an arm of ACORN, former national director Newman insists that Project Vote is a separate organization.  You could even have "separate organization" as being of the same status as what's cited to the NY Times and TIME (i.e. not an allegation), so long as the cited sources for "separate" say "separate" and are not merely interpreted as saying "separate".  Again, there is no mutual exclusivity here. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mScjessey: Now I think you are being intentionally disruptive. PV is '''not''' an arm of ACORN, and the two mainstream sources you are citing are demonstrably wrong. The former director of the organization has publicly stated they are separate, and PV's 501(c)(3) status ''requires'' it to be a separate organization. TIME and NYT aren't going to be printing any corrections ''four years'' after the fact. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH6: Refutation
[32mArzel: You are intentionally ignoring reliable evidence showing the connection...I think it is you that is being intentionally disruptive.  As I said earlier, one organization can be an "arm" and be seperate from the other.  Newman, above, is quite cleaver in crafting his words to make the point that Obama didn't work for ACORN, but not make the statement that PV and ACORN are not closely related.  He also doesn't say that PV is not an arm of ACORN, and as I clearly stated earlier, it is common for one organization to be an arm of another yet be seperate entities.  The fear of any link between Obama and ACORN is so strong as to have clouded the judgement of many here.  It is time for this craziness to end.  We have reliable source stating that PV is an "arm" of ACORN, unless it can be proven that this is a lie there is no reason to continue to stonewall. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[31mScjessey: '"We have reliable source stating that PV is an "arm" of ACORN, unless it can be proven that this is a lie"''
Sorry, but the burden of proof always lies with the person wishing to add information to the article, so the contentious "arm" phrasing cannot be added until there is a consensus that agrees with its use. The reliability of the sources has been called into question because of more recent evidence and sources (as opposed to four-year-old inaccurate sources) indicating separation. It is our duty to ''exclude'' contentious details when their veracity is suspect. The continued '''push''' to use "arm" is strong evidence of agenda-driven editing, and this is simply not acceptable in Wikipedia. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mBdell555: The proof has been clearly shown.  The New York Times and TIME believe that the sources like Michelle Malkin which refer to PV as a "503 arm" are clearly accurate.  ACORN evidently agrees, reprinting the terminology on its website, despite the fact it is in ACORN's interest to play up the separation.  Even a blind squirrel like Malkin can find an acorn sometimes.  Project Vote's current director has styled himself as working for "Project Vote/ACORN".  Your own agenda has apparently caused you to reject the proof by imagining that an entity cannot possibly be an "arm" and be "separate" to an extent at the same time.  This "all birds must be yellow" argument of yours was refuted days ago. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mArzel: Sorry, but if you have a problem with the RS then take it to WP:RS for clarrification.  You cannot simply decide when a reliable source is deemed unreliable.  The NYT and TIME are both WP:RS, if you start treading down the path of judging when their reporting is reliable you have completely run off the path of good judgement.  You don't even have a RS which contradicts either the NYT or TIME.  The onus has been shown.  WP:V, WP:WEIGHT, WP:RS have all been satisfied, there is no other reason for dismissal other than that you don't believe it.  I see only one agenda being driven here.  The agenda to obscure as much as possible the relationship between the two, which is most ironic when ACORN clearly identifies itself with PV in a very substantial manner. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mScjessey: Completely wrong. The NYT and TIME articles are inaccurate, but neither will print a retraction '''four years''' after the articles were written. And who cares what Michelle Malkin says? She is a conservative pundit, and it is not Wikipedia's job to regurgitate punditry and pretend it is the truth. Remember that it was Malkin who practically urged people to boycott Dunkin' Donuts because of a scarf that Rachel Ray was wearing. Certainly there is no consensus for "arm" in any case, and I doubt this will change anytime soon. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mArzel: How do you know that the NYT and TIME artilces are inaccurate about PV being created as an arm of ACORN?  Your strawman arguements carry no weight.  Unless you can prove that the NYT and TIME articles are inaccurate then you have no basis for rejection. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Repeated argument
[31mScjessey: What straw man arguments? We have a cast-iron primary source, and we have supplemental primary sources in the form of court documents and tax status. Secondary sources are also available, though less specific. I haven't done a search yet, but I will. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mBdell555: According to Simon, the League of Women Voters Education Fund cannot be an "arm" of the League of Women Voters.  Why?  Because this "Education Fund" is a 501(c)(3) and, as Simon argues, "NYT and TIME state that PV is an "arm" of ACORN. PV is a separate entity to ACORN, as evidenced by PV's 501(c)(3) status. Therefore, NYT and TIME are in error. Q.E.D.".  All those sources that describe this Education Fund an an "arm"?  All necessarily "in error", by Simon's logic.  Same with all those sources that describe the NRA Foundation as an "arm" of the NRA. The United States Student Association Foundation?  "Separate" from the United States Student Association in Simon's world.  Is the ACLU even a reliable source about itself?  Not according to Simon, because it says on aclu.org that "[t]he ACLU Foundation (ACLUF) is the national tax-deductible, 501(c)(3) arm of the ACLU." rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mBdell555: Why should we care what Sanford Newman says, in that case?  Is he any less in the bag for Obama than Malkin is out of it?  Rick Block's absence of sources don't trump real sources, and your partisan sources don't trump partisan sources on the other side anymore than they are themselves trumped.  Fact is, I don't necessarily have a problem with your partisan sources (there being no necessary link between partisanship and reliability when it comes to claims of fact as opposed to conclusions and opinions) as I've encouraged you to add them if you think "arm" needs to be nuanced somehow. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[36mRick Block: Can you please explain why it's so important to include the precise phrase "arm of" in this article given that there are other more precise, more meaningful, and (at least in some editors' opinion) more accurate ways of describing the relationship between these two organizations?  You're heard the arguments against and apparently reject them.  What's the argument ''for'' choosing to use this specific terminology among all other possible ways to describe these two organizations?  Because the NY Times and TIME Magazine said it means we might consider using it, but given there are reasons not to use these words (albeit reasons you reject), why these words rather than any others? rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mBdell555: If you've been following me, you'd note that I've never advocated "these words rather than any others".  I have no objections to other descriptions appearing as well, so long as they are equally well sourced and reflect what the sources directly say as opposed to someone's subjective interpretation.  I'm not the one lobbying for an incomplete or partial description. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mArzel: I agree.  "Arm" is not a requirement, only that the proper origination of PV be identified.  It is clear from the RS available that ACORN is the originator, there have been no RS that have denied this connection.  In fact the only reason I have seen to reject this connection is because of a belief that there is an agenda to associate Obama with the  transgressions of ACORN.  Since there is no attempt to make this connection here, there should be no reason to cloud the truth which is verifiable. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mArzel: Strawman 1... Malkin, Strawman 2... that the NYT or the TIMES won't print a retraction after 4 years.  Your "cast-iron" source doesn't make the claim that they are not born of each other, only that Obama worked for PV and not ACORN. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mRick Block: Curious.  You don't care that it says "arm" specifically, yet you edit war to make it so.  How about "affiliated with", like it says on the ACORN website?  The point several people are making is that being a 501c(3) organization that is simply an "arm" of another, non-501c(3) organization, is arguably illegal (depending, of course, on what the ill-defined phrase "arm of" means).  They must be legally separate.  By using "arm of" the article is now strongly implying these organizations are not separate.  Project Vote is unquestionably a 501c(3) organization.  It is unquestionably affiliated with ACORN.  Why say "is an arm of" when "is a 501c(3) organization, affiliated with" is more accurate and less contentious? rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
