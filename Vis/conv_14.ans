[31m2605:8D80:6E2:46EE:286A:BC79:6F37:4402: Why is this article written like an advertisement? It reads like it's written by an insecure teenager trying to boast about their city. The most, the best, the biggest, widely recognized, prominent, well known, largest... I mean does no one else think this is kind of sad? I know Toronto wants to prove it's a "world class" city, but this is excessive. I'm not suggesting rewording the entire article, but it should be toned down, especially the four lead paragraphs. After all this is an encyclopedia not a tourism ad. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mJohnny Au: I would like to know specific examples, as currently, it is rather neutral.  Once the "advertisement" parts are identified, they can be fixed and perhaps we can nominate it for good article status.   / rebuttal_labels:: 
[34m50.100.252.149: How about Revision as of by . This edits just reeks of desperation for acknowledgement. Not many cities have such desperate tones in their LEAD PARAGRAPH! rebuttal_labels:: 
[34m50.100.252.149: I proposed the lead paragraph be changed to something that doesn't sound so desperately sad, such as:
â€³''Toronto is the capital city of the Canadian province of Ontario, Canada and is located on the northern shore of Lake Ontario. The 2016 census recorded a population of 2,731,571 and a metropolitan population of 5,928,040 making Toronto the largest city in Canada. A global city, Toronto is a centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural cities in the world.''â€³
Maybe removing the some of the excessive fluff will make this article lead far more encyclopedic. rebuttal_labels::

[34m50.100.252.149: I see that small changes were made, the lead still needs some major changes, may I suggest:
'Toronto is the capital city of the province of Ontario, Canada. An established ''(is there a non-established global city?)'' global city, Toronto is an international ''(Canadian)'' centre of business, finance, arts, and culture ''(Toronto widely criticized for lack of culture)'' and widely ''(original research)'' recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan ''(not in references)'' cities in the world. It is the most populous city in Canada, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, ''(absolutely unheard of and irrelevant outside of Ontario)'' the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2016 census recorded a population of 2,731,571. In 2015, the population was estimated at 2,826,498, ''(est. irrelevant now that 2016 census released)'' making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on city limits (behind Los Angeles), while it is the fifth-largest (behind Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area ''(widely debated stat considering CMA's and MSA's are drastically differing. Also this sentence sounds plan sad and desperate)''''
A lot of original research and peacock terms still in the lead paragraph rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mAlaney2k: After looking at comparable city articles like Chicago, it seems that the city leads seem to start with most populous, etc. For whatever reason, this is what the eds have been writing. This includes the ranking versus other cities. It's not great, but I don't think it sounds desperate either. Being in the first paragraph, it is probably too prominent. Cosmopolitan is a bit vague, maybe they were going for liberal, open, etc. I'm not sure about the criticism about culture. That seems subjective. I mean, sure I have heard complaints about culture, living here, but I don't have a sense of how to rank levels of being cultured. There are lots of galleries, live theatres, live entertainment venues, and all sorts of media located in Toronto. The criticism I've read is more of a scolding nature, intending to out some backwardness and lack of confidence in some institutions, without any historical reference. Within my lifetime, Toronto has leaped forward in a lot of areas, so I really don't feel so harsh about it. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[35mJPark99: I strongly disagree with you that this article is written like an advertisement or tourism article. I and many others have worked and continue to work to improve this article along Wikipedia guidelines, and I feel that the lead of this article is written from a neutral point of view that states facts and information about Toronto backed up with strong references, and does not attempt to compare Toronto to other cities, to promote Toronto as superior to other cities, or to sway opinion. That said, I am interested to know which parts of this article you think are written like an advertisement, and how you would propose to "tone down" the article. Please provide specific examples. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
