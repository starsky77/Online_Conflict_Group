[31mNaturaNaturans: Removing "World Pantheist Movement" Advertising on Pantheism page rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mNaturaNaturans: Wikipedia should not be a method of advertising for an environmentalist political group that identifies with "pantheism".  There is no "symbol" of pantheism and "The World Pantheist Movement" picture should not be the first thing readers see when looking up pantheism.  Furthermore, there have been excessive references to "The World Pantheist Movement" and so-called "naturalistic pantheism" political views imposed onto this page.  Wikipedia readers deserve an impartial view of what pantheism is all about, not just an environmentalist political person's agenda that has little to do with what has been called pantheism for over 100 years.

[32mNaturalistic: Hmmm, Allisgod aka Rev Allen White of Unity Church in Silver Spring, I thought we had progressed beyond paranoid attacks from you. I have tried to develop a cooperative approach between us dedicated to neutrality and accuracy. You have assiduously promoted your own agenda of determinism and "Classical Pantheism" in your contributions. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mNaturalistic: The spiral is the pantheism symbol in widest use on planet today and the World Pantheist Movement is by a long stretch the largest pantheist organization on the planet so there's nothing unusual in mentioning it. Moreover, Naturalistic Pantheism does not get special treatment since all the forms of pantheism are mentioned and described without bias in favor of one or the other. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mNaturalistic: By attacking the WPM in the way you do, you blatantly reveal your own biassed agenda. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mNaturaNaturans: Certain groups of Hinduism, Taoism, Wicca, and Kabbalah, among others, are the largest pantheist groups on the planet, not an internet website soliciting donations for environmental causes.  Determinism and Classical Pantheism are not my agenda.  I happen to be an environmentalist as well and donate to environmental causes.  That doesn't mean I try to twist around a deep word born out of Spinoza's philosophy on wikipedia to promote environmental politics.  That would be what you're doing and that is unacceptable.  Wikipedia is not for self promotion.  In fact, members of the Church of Scientology were recently banned from Wikipedia for trying to control the page on Scientology.  You're taking it a step further beyond the "World Pantheist Movement" wikipedia page and are trying to control the "Pantheism" page to suit your purposes.  Your "spiral" is a symbol of a donation based organization used to promote itself.  That symbol does not belong on the wikipedia page on pantheism.

[32mNaturalistic: Okay, I agree to removing the symbols and hope that you agree to removing your panegyric of Spinoza. I would suggest a lineup of famous pantheist faces instead: Marcus Aurelius, Girodano Bruno, Spinoza, Wordsworth, Whitman, Emerson, DH Lawrence, Frank Lloyd Wright, Einstein, Margaret Atwood.

[31mNaturaNaturans: I take issue with you referring to the highlighting of Spinoza on a page on pantheism as "panegyric".  Pantheism is inextricably bound to no one more influential figure than Spinoza.  That is a plain fact and you cannot use a wikipedia page to attempt to mitigate the fact that the man is referenced first by just about everyone who uses the word pantheism.  If you choose to use the word in a different way and for another purpose, that's your prerogative.  But you are doing a disservice to people looking for information on wikipedia when you try and force your divergent viewpoint upon a popular information page.

[32mNaturalistic: Panegyric refers to the effusive language and references to prince and prophet etc. These are pure evoluations without information content. Spinoza represents one specific type of Pantheism and focussing so powerfully on him actually reduces the page's neutrality. Placing such emphasis on Hartshorne, a panentheist critic of pantheism, also distorts the page's neutrality. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Stating your stance
[32mNaturalistic: Re agendas, I have repeatedly explained what my agenda here is: neutrality, accuracy, and avoidance of personal point of view (POV) and original research (OR). I will continue to vigorously defend these Wikipedia principles which you frequently ignore and I can do so indefinitely. You have explicitly explained that your agenda is pushing Spinoza, Hartshorne and determinism. Inclusion of the largest pantheist organization in the world is natural in an article on Pantheism. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mNaturalistic: I have repeatedly asked for cooperation, mutual respect and so on and you have continued to choose confrontation and edit wars. Until we begin to proceed on the basis of cooperation, this situation will persist. I was content to leave the page as it was about a month ago and it stayed that way for several weeks and included quite a number of changes in your direction, which I was not entirely happy with but left alone for the sake of peace and continuity. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
