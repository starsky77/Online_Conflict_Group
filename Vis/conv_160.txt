In reality, Sheldrake's argument is in no sense a scientific argument but is an exercise in pseudo-science... Many readers will be left with the impression that Sheldrake has succeeded in finding a place for magic within scientific discussion – and this, indeed, may have been a part of the objective of writing such a book.[13]''", 'username': 'Tom Butler', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
