[31mM.K: Non existing name rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mM.K: There is no such names as "Truce of Niemie≈ºa" ; as well as the "name" "Niemie≈ºa" is met only in PL google books scraps , in contrast to proper place name ''Nemƒó≈æis'' . Therefore such article naming is disputed. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mPiotrus: I see no refs for Truce/Treaty of Nemezis in the links you provided.| rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mM.K: You failed to produce any English sources which would support current name, therefore tag restored. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mLokyz: From the provided links it is obvious, that most common name of the treaty in English language is Treaty of Vilna as Piotrus beloved google book search suggests - no Treaty of Wilno, (except in patriotic writings in the beginning of 19th century by physician) ando no Truce of Nemieza is found. While it may be popular in Polish historiography, this is English wikipedia and most commone name should be used. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mPiotrus: I would not oppose a move to the Truce of Vilna.| rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mLokyz: Care to provide any better books body count references than Treaty of Vilna? rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mPiotrus: Huh? Please be more clear.| rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mLokyz: Well, as I've said earlier It seems that most common name for this ''treaty'' in English is ''Treaty of Vilna'', not ''truce of Vilna''. Aslo please, stop removing citation request and stop shuffling references around - Wilno and Nemeiza is the least  known names for this treaty, so there is no need to weaselise it by inserting wors like '''sometimes'''. ''Treaty of Vilna'' gets 34 (!) hits, truce of Vilna one book from 1841, treaty of Wilno one book by physician, and truce of Nemieza - a big zero. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mM.K: I would like at last to receive and EN publication which would use ''Truce of Niemie≈ºa'' as name, currently there none. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mPiotrus: On Wikipedia we distinguish between truces and treaties, just see the naming of relevant articles. Hence truce is more correct than treaty. I don't mind switching to Vilna, particularly if you stop disrupting the well-referenced "truce of Niem≈ºa" (based on translation of Polish term, and at least as good as your ref for Trakai Voivodeship).| rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mLokyz: On Wikipedia we difference article names per WP:UE and most common name. references are provided, name is known as Treaty of Vilna. Should I move the article accordingly to as you did with the Eldership of Samogitia, that's still unreferenced? This move would be clear because of most known English name as it reads Treaty of Vilna. Check the references yourself. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mPiotrus: Per Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names), in this case, our convention is to refer to truces as truces. Are you disputing it was a truce? | rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mPiotrus: First, could you show me an EN publication that uses Trakai Voivodeship? | rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mLokyz: I think, this reference is put in the article by you. Correct me if I'm wrong. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mPiotrus: I referenced all possible names. Not all of them are as correct, which is why the article is no longer named Truce/Treaty of Niemie≈ºa... or would you like to move it back? Dozens of refs support those variants, too... | rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mLokyz: Ghm, so the ''most common name'' policy does not apply? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mPiotrus: If my explanation don't help, I guess you need a practical lesson. America is more often used w/ regards to United States of America than the full name. Same for US and USA. Go ahead and move that article to its more common name, and than let's discuss this further. Or if you feel less bold, read the discussion here.| rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mLokyz: Once again one did fail to provide any exact answer to my question. A really convenient position taken. I'll repeat my recent question. so the ''most common name'' policy does not apply? Or is someone making policies of his own? like IRC shopping? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
