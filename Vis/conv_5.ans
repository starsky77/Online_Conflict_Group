[31mParsecboy: Something to consider: in Google books, we have the following results:
Agstev river - 53
Aghstev river - 20
Aghstafa river - 2 (one of which does not refer to the river, but to the city
Agstafa river - 7 (only one of which appears to be about the river)
In Google Scholar, we get the following:
Aghstev river - 9 (of which 2 appear to refer to the river)
Agstev river - 9 (most of which appear to be about the river)
Agstafa river - 16 (only one appears to be about the river)
Aghstafa river 9 (only 1 or 2 appear to be about the river)
Based on this fairly quick Google sampling, it seems that either Agstev or Aghstev are favored in scholarly books, while they are pretty evenly split in scholarly journals (i.e, only a couple of appearances for each spelling variation). Based on the Google Book results, it seems that Agstev is the preferred spelling in English. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mGrandmaster: It is preferred spelling, when Armenia is described, but the books and articles about Azerbaijan use the name of Aghstafa. The river has different names in different countries, but there does not seem to be a generally accepted English version of the name, that is used to refer to the river along its entire length. I have never seen a book or a serious international source that would call Azerbaijani section of the river Aghstev, and the city of Aghstafa cannot be located on the river of Aghstev. There are no towns called after this river in Armenia, that's why the spelling of Aghstafa is better. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mParsecboy: Check the first result in the Google Book search for Agstev. It's a UN publication that refers to both Armenia and Azerbaijan, and uses Agstev river. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mGrandmaster: The most popular in google books is Russianized spelling Akstafa river, which gets 254 hits:  It is the most popular spelling since the region was a part of the Russian empire and USSR. Akstafa river also gets 36 hits on google scholar: rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mParsecboy: Although by putting it in quotes (to remove the possibility of there being returns with just "Akstafa" or "river"), you get 55 results for Akstafa. It seems that of the three, Aghstafa is the least preferred. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mGrandmaster: Well, Akstafa is corrupted Aghstafa, so it is still the most popular spelling in scholarly literature. We can go with Akstafa, if that solves the problem. If we put Agstev river in quotes, it will get only 33 hits, which is less than 55 hits of Akstafa river, so the latter is more common. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mParsecboy: I would be fine with Akstafa, it is used by reputable organizations like the US's National Geographic Society. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mGrandmaster: Me too, if no one objects. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mBrandmeister (old): One minor issue is that the letters "gh" in "Aghstafa" spelling more neatly deliver the Azeri sound "ÄŸ". rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mGrandmaster: True. So let's decide, Aghstafa or Akstafa. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mBrandmeister (old): I personally sway to Aghstafa, as it is, but one may choose Akstafa for there are less clashing consonants. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mParsecboy: (od) Aghstafa seems to be the least preferred in English language sources. Akstafa seems preferable to me. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mGrandmaster: I don't mind either Aghstafa or Akstafa. The latter is preferable, if we go for the most common name in English language sources. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mVacio: Akstafa is the Russian name of the river (and not a "Russianized spelling"), and I don't agree that because "Akstafa river" and "Aghstafa river" ''together'' get more hits in books.google than Aghsev ''alone'', the latter must be left out. In ''google.com'' "Akstafa river" gets only '''25 hits''' , much lesser than "Aghstev" which gets '''239 hits''' . The fact that in ''books.google'' "Aghstev river" gets lesser hits than "Akstafa river" is because you get there generally academical stuff often based on Russian sources (some of these hits are from SSSR geographical documents). I think ''google.com'' shows clearly that "Aghstev river" is the most common name in English language sources. It is used by at least 2 UN publications () and also according to books.google () the from Agstev is used by:
American Meteorological Society
American Geological Institute
American Water Works Association
American Geographical Society of New York rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mVacio: I therefore request that the title of the article should be moved ''back'' to "Aghstev river" before further discussion, because it was moved by Parishan without any discussion and I think it was not justified. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mVacio: Also, I think we should discuss the issue in a wider context. There are many rivers which first flow trough Armenia and later Azerbaijan. I hope we will not go each time the same way as here. We should discuss a general policy on naming such geographical names. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mGrandmaster: According to the rules, google search is not a mandatory reason for rename of the articles. Google search returns mostly Armenian sources or sources reporting from Armenia. Akstafa is more popular with specialist sources, as it was demonstrated. Agstafa is also used by authoritative sources, and Akstafa used even more than any other name. So we should stick to either the present title, or Akstafa, as it is the most popular name in the specialist sources. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH4: Repeated argument
[36mVacio: And according to which rule the article was renamed from "Aghstev river" to Aghstafa river" by Parishan?! And it absolutely untrue that google gets ''mostly Armenian sources or sources reporting from Armenia''. Look above how many non-Armenian organisations use the Agstev. The WP rules require that the most common name in English must be preferable, which in this case is manifsetly Aghstev. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation, DH5: Counterargument
[32mGrandmaster: It is impossible to establish a common English name by a simple google search. Google books shows that the specialist sources prefer Akstafa. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[35mMeowy: That's just because the English can't pronounce "gh" correctly! Given that the river is of minor international importance and notability, we can't use Google to decide on how it should be spelt. Nor can we directly use the Armenian or Azeri alphabets for the title. The name needs to be as close as possible to the actual pronounciation. For either version, "gh" seems closer than "k". As for which version to use, there should be Wikipedia guidelines. The problem must have come up before, and not just in relation to Armenia/Azerbaijan cross-border rivers. How much of the river is in Armenia, how much is in Azerbaijan? Is it more important in one country than in the other? Is it usual to refer to rivers that are tributaries of larger rivers by their source name, or by the name in use at the locations where they join the larger rivers? rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mGrandmaster: I believe the importance of Azeri spelling of Aghstafa or the Russian Akstafa is based on the fact that there's a town in Azerbaijan, named after the river. The town of Aghstafa is the center of the district by the same name. It would look strange if we write that the town of Aghstafa is located on the river Aghstev, after which it is named. At the same time, no town in Armenia is named after this river. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mVacio: That argument makes no sense whatsoever. There is a town in Armenia called Yeraskh, so according to you a can go and just move Aras River to Yeraskh River without even adding a letter to the talk page!? It is also a false argumantation of you as if the longest part of the river flows trough Azerbaijan. The part of the river which flows through Armenian is twice longer than the part of it in Azerbaijan (see this map)! rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[32mGrandmaster: Aras is different. It is a large river, known in English sources for centuries. Akstafa is a small river, and it forms only one town, the center of a district. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mMeowy: Maybe we have to look at it at a different angle. Articles have titles so that the articles can be found. What would someone searching for information about the river call the river, bearing in mind that they are searching the English-language Wikipedia? So maybe Akstafa ''is'' the best choice. (Yep - I know I was saying it wasn't in the last post I made!) rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mGrandmaster: I don'tmind, let it be Russianized Akstafa, after all, it is the name accepted in scholarly sources. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mVacio: Meowy, for what reason the article would bear the title ''Akstafa'', when it is almost 10x lesser common in google then Aghstev? Also why would a river which flows through ''Armenia'''and for a little part in ''Azerbaijan'', have an ''Russian'' name? Please also note that I have been asking for reasonable arguments in support for the troublesome move of the article by Parishan (who so far has not typed a single word in this talkpage). What concerns me here is the policy of some Azeri users, the ''first'' move an Armenian name ''then'' try to justify it with false argumantations: (hits in google.az, representing the Russian name of the river as a "corrupt spelling", asserting that the part of the river which flows through Azerbaijan is longer than which flows through Armenia, etc). rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[32mGrandmaster: Google search is not a mandatory reason for rename. As I said, Akstafa is the name used in scholarly literature, and there are cities named after the river in Azerbaijan. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH5: Counterargument
