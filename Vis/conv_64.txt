{'text': "Hello, all: The large amount of space given to  one FDA letter during VanderSloot's rather long life seems to be a good instance of contradicting WP:Undue. Therefore, I am making a subhead for that phase of the article and marking it for attention. I really don't think it should be used at all: It is equivalent to reporting on a speeding ticket that one of his truckdrivers might have received back in 1997. Please comment on whether this section should or should not be deleted.\nAn article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject. For example, discussion of isolated events, criticisms, or news reports about a subject may be verifiable and impartial, but still disproportionate to their overall significance to the article topic. This is a concern especially in relation to recent events that may be in the news. Note that undue weight can be given in several ways, including, but not limited to, depth of detail, quantity of text, prominence of placement, and juxtaposition of statements.\nThank you.", 'username': 'BeenAroundAWhile', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
{'text': "I disagree that it is unduly weighted. It has been mentioned by secondary sources and is described succinctly in the article and only in as much detail as is necessary to convey the gist. Suggesting that FDA warnings are analogous to a speeding ticket is nothing more than a personal opinion (c.f. WP:OR) and it demonstrates a lack of understating of their significance. It's especially relevant given that VS had a serious run-in with the FDA for similar issues while running Oil of Melaleuca. If anything, you have given it even more weight by offsetting it into a separate section.", 'username': 'Rhode Island Red', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument', 'DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': '\'\'Remove the entire item.\'\'\' (1) Please read the original posting at the top of this section. (2) The reason the item now has a subheader is so that a tag could be placed on just one particular section. The tag reads: "An editor has expressed a concern that this section lends undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, controversies or matters relative to the article subject as a whole. Please help to create a more balanced presentation. \'\'Discuss and resolve this issue before removing this message.\'\' (Emphasis supplied.)  (3) There is only one Source given for this item, in a trade website. (The other Source is the letter itself, which is not good enough in Wikipedia\'s eyes to use as a Source alone.) This factoid about Melaleuca was never the object of scrutiny in any other Reliable Source, nor reported on elsewhere. It is therefore \'\'de minimis.\'\' It is, given the thousands of products made by Melaleuca, just not worth trifling about. Nor, given the fact that this article is about a Living Person and not a company, does it warrant even a mention in the biography of this man.', 'username': 'BeenAroundAWhile', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': "FDA's involvement with Oil of Melaleuca is a big deal.  The 1997 letter is a different matter.  The letter itself states that it is not a reflection of Melaleuca in general, which is how it is being used in this article.  To put it in the proper context, the warning letter would require either a very long explanation or original research, neither of which is appropriate.  The FDA also did not say that the claims were necessarily untrue, since that's beyond its statutory purview.", 'username': 'Andrewman327', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': "It doesn't require a long explanation at all. It has a short explanation now and it serves the purpose fine. All the key details are there, the primary and secondary source are linked, and no additional context is necessary. FDA warnings are pretty straightforward and unambiguous. They don't deal with whether or not claims are true; simply whether or not they are legal, and in this case the claims were not legal. DSHEA provides blanket rules specifying what sellers of dietary supplements can and cannot say about their products; when companies break the rules, they get a warning and then fines/sanctioned if they refuse to comply with the order. The FDA warning is relevant and noteworthy enough on its own, but even more so given that VS's previous company had an identical run in with the FDA and received the same type of warning.", 'username': 'Rhode Island Red', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'It is \'\'not\'\' up to Wikipedia to assert what you seem to wish us to assert.  All supplement companies get FDA letters.  A "warning" is of de minimis importance in a BLP.   If you found a fine being paid, that would warrant some WEIGHT, the warning, by itself, is heavily overweighted at this point.', 'username': 'Collect', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'FDA has a 21 page manual explaining what warning letters are and I stand by what I said about it being too wonky to be able to describe without either making it sound worse than it was or giving the section undue weight. As far as I can tell, FDA has never taken an administrative action against the company.  Even the letter they sent 15 years ago did not apply to the company writ large.', 'username': 'Andrewman327', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH4: Repeated argument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'It was stated above that the letter "has been mentioned by secondary sources." I think\'\' just one\'\' secondary source.

{'text': 'Sorry, but I don\'t buy any consensus based on a voting block exclusively from WP Project Conservatism, and especially not a consensus based on  simple "me too" comments and WP:OR. This is a chronic problem that needs to be addressed with the admins if it continues. FDA warning letters are indeed significant and highly notable. Your assertion to the contrary is WP:OR. The warning letter IS an administrative action.', 'username': 'Rhode Island Red', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument', 'DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
