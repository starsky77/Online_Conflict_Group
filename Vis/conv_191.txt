Gee, if there are only 451 google hits and you've never heard of it, I guess that means it must not really exist then, right?  Sorry, but I DO object, especially part of what you deleted included a reference.

{'text': 'I am going to go with Gaaarg on this one.  This page is intended to be a general introduction to reggae.  I do not feel that having the term JAH THRONE (although it may be a perfectly valid term in reggae), in the page would lead folks in the right direction.  I think we should keep it out for now.  With all due respect, please post your motivation for including this term along with the term "rockers".  Regarding the comment on citations and the amount of work involved, sometimes it is hard work conforming to the standards of this encyclopedia and sometimes it gets erased outright.  Just because something is difficult doesn\'t give it precedence to stay in the page.  After your motivation is posted and it seems that the page would be lacking without term JAH THRONE, then it should be reinstated.', 'username': 'Migglesworth', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH4: Stating your stance'], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
