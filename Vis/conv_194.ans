[31mSandyGeorgia: , you've added a lot of sourcing to
Cannon, Barry. ''Hugo Ch√°vez and the Bolivarian Revolution: Populism and Democracy in a Globalised Age''. (Manchester 2010).
Could you please establish Barry Cannon's credentials here, and include some scholarly reviews of his book? rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mSandyGeorgia: Cannon sourcing rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mSandyGeorgia: In addition to general credentials and scholarly reviews of his book, we will need to gain access to this journal article to determine if he is a neutral writer. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mRd232: Cannon is an academic at Dublin City University. The book is published by Manchester University Press. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mLucky to be me: Of course. Firstly, Barry Cannon is a post-doctoral fellow at the school of law and government, Dublin City University, Ireland. His book ''Hugo Ch√°vez and the Bolivarian Revolution: Populism and Democracy in a Globalised Age'' is published by Manchester University Press, an academic publishing company (hence the name). So, 1). The book is written by a professional academic. 2). It is published by an academic publishing house.
Secondly, you ask for academic reviews:
Amid often polemical and ideological discussion of the person and project of Hugo Ch√°vez, Cannon's book offers a careful and broadranging examination of the context, causes and characteristics and consequences of Chavismo that provides a firm basis for a balanced assessment. Of particular significance is its excellent overview of Latin American populism and its clarification of the various dialogical hues it can adopt, thereby cutting through the dense fog that so often clouds discussion of this enduring political phenomenon. This book is a major contribution to the burgeoning literature on the ‚Äònew left‚Äô in Latin America.‚Äô  Professor Peadar Kirby, University of Limerick. (From back cover).''Cannon, Barry.

[34mLucky to be me: You need to find reliable sources if you want to dicredit the content in the book. Removal of these references - without authorative backing - will count as original research, and therefore be inappropriate in relation the Wikipedia guidelines. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mSandyGeorgia: That's not how it works, Lucky: you're the one adding the source (I only add sources with a known reputation for fact checking or scholarly reviews, and am sure to use them correctly). Information from the book cover doesn't establish anything; please find scholarly reviews or something to establish the author's credentials, and please avoid citing Wiki policy and guideline to me if you don't know them. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mSandyGeorgia: Rd, do you know how to fix that link above so we don't get the cookie problem again?  I should have a copy of that article by tonight. Hopefully by then, Lucky will have something as well ) rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mSandyGeorgia: Also, Lucky, since you have the book, can you please tell us what sources he used for economic data?  Thanks, rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mSandyGeorgia: I now have the above-listed paper by Cannon, which makes not even the barest minimum attempt at neutrality or critical analysis of Golinger's book; it's nothing but a fan paper, so we have ourselves a less than neutral source in Cannon.  I suggest that someone try to find a scholarly review of his book, before we use it.  Lucky, since you're using it to source economic data, please describe to us explicitly what sources he uses to develop economic data.  Does he use any independent sources, or is it all Gov't data?  Does he make any attempt to attach appropriate disclaimers to the gov't data, or does he just parrot it as he does the claims in Golinger's book? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mSandyGeorgia: Cannon, lecturer for Marxism 2009 festival of Socialist Workers Party. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mRd232: Panellist, not lecturer. And so what? It's an obvious place to promote his book. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mRd232: The book only came out in 2009, so it's probably too early for scholarly reviews (at least, I haven't found any yet). Cannon's book review of an Eva Golinger book is followed in the same journal issue by another hardly any more critical review (of a different book by Golinger) by someone else. In any case, if we take this academic book to WP:RSN nobody's going to care about a book review which doesn't fit your opinion. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mSandyGeorgia: There's no need to take it to RSN; we just have to know what we're using (as we do in all cases).  For instance, we need to know if we're parroting government data, CEPR, Golinger, Weisbrot, etc.  It is up to Lucky to be more forthcoming about what is in the book, and what data and sources it uses, so we can attribute it correctly, and decide whether it belongs in this article or elsewhere (daughter articles), according to due weight. It's a matter of using sources correctly. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mSandyGeorgia: Just that it's the only thing I can find (and is an indication of what market the book appeals to). rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mSandyGeorgia: Also, same for Meade; we need to know what data she's citing. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mRd232: the "market the book appeals to" - please. It appeals to people interested in an academic assessment of ''Hugo Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution: Populism and Democracy in a Globalised Age''. It should hardly surprise you that this includes a bunch of old lefties. NB it's just been issued in paperback. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mJrtayloriv: The fact that this book appeals to Marxists is no more relevant than the fact that the Wall Street Journal appeals primarily to upper-class capitalists, as far as reliability is concerned. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[35mBCLH: Hugo Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution: Populism and Democracy in a Globalised Age Barry Cannon (Lecturer DCU) and Sean Mitichell (SWP), It is a Lecturer in a Marxist Festival, he can be a Marxist but I think that eliminates him as a neutral or a reliable source of information. He speak spanish and remember that Venezuela Government has a lobby of its ideas all over the world. And most of the info of Cannon is not updated rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
