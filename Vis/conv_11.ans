[31mPjeterPeter: Kosovo is going to compete as an equal independent nation at the 2016 Summer Olympics. Adding status 'issues' or political statements is useless and unnecessary. So let's just keep these sport-related pages away from politics, please! rebuttal_labels::

[32mQwerty786: do you have any info that Serbia no longer disputes kosovo independence? Link to where Serbia has recognized Kosovo independence. This is a wiki mandate on all Kosovo articles. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mPjeterPeter: This is not about Serbia, it's about Kosovo. Go to the official Olympic page, and it clearly shows that Kosovo will participate as an independent country. We're on the Olympic page, and the IOC recognized Kosovo. We're not talking about Serbia or its politics. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mQwerty786: prove with links Kosovo is no longer a disputed nation. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mPjeterPeter: This is about the "Republic of Kosovo", which is recognized by 108/193 UN countries - it's not about the disputed territory. It's going to be about the independent country. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument

[34mIJA: Kosovo is to compete as a sovereign state at the Olympics, this isn't a dispute, it is a fact. The Kosovo note is non-binding as Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Kosovo-related articles is only a ''proposed'' Wikipedia Policy/ Guideline. The note isn't required as this isn't a political article and NPOV isn't being violated by referring to Kosovo as Kosovo, nor is NPOV being violated by saying that Kosovo will participate at the Olympics. The note violates WP:UNDUE as it gives undue weight to a political dispute on a sport article. We don't have a note on Taiwan or Palestine competing at the Olympics do we? Also please use the proper WP:RM process when wanting to move an article, I'll report next time a page is moved unilaterally. Also let me remind you both of WP:3RR and WP:CONSENSUS. If I find out you've been edit warring again, I'll report you both. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation, DH5: Counterargument
[32mQwerty786: if you go to Chinese Taipei at the Olympics you will see that it is always explained why it is not called Taiwan. And how about all the other sports articles that have the note? Don't be ignorant. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mIJA: You sir are set for a lengthy ban for your disruptive actions. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mQwerty786: you don't even know what you are talking about. Talking about "Taiwan" in the Olympics. That's ignorance of Wikipedia and Olympics. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mIJA: '"you don't even know what you are talking about"'' is a non-argument, good luck with your future edits on wikipedia. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH-1: Bailing out
