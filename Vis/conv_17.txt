Consequently, Sabiha Gokcen may might as well belong in the Armenian people article. Therefore, in order to reduce a rather unnecessary dispute over this matter (disputes in the past similar to this resulted in a delisting of this article's GA status), I propose we swap Sabiha Gokcen picture with that of Mimar Kemaleddin or another ethnic Turk.", 'username': 'EtienneDolet', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits', 'Suggesting a compromise']}

The Turkish government may say a lot of things, that doesn't mean it should be accepted outright. Therefore, to avoid continuing this endless debate and discussion, I think swapping Sabiha Gokcen for another ethnic Turk is a good proposal. What's so wrong about that? Mimar Kemaleddin's picture is nice as well. There are dozens of other ethnic Turks that deserve to be up there. Do you really want to continue arguing this for ages?
