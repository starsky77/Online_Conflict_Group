[31mTom Butler: This article is seriously biased toward the prevailing skeptical view rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mTom Butler: I have placed a NPOV tag on the article. it is clear that the majority of text here is negative with no pretense of presenting the man as his work. In all, it is being used to attack his views, rather than simply discussing his views.
For instance, under Books, we have: ''...Sheldrake's book is a splendid illustration of the widespread public misconception of what science is about. In reality, Sheldrake's argument is in no sense a scientific argument but is an exercise in pseudo-science... Many readers will be left with the impression that Sheldrake has succeeded in finding a place for magic within scientific discussion â€“ and this, indeed, may have been a part of the objective of writing such a book.[13]'' rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mTom Butler: And more. There are many comments supporting the book, but of course, they are published in unacceptable publications. The solution is to just say what and not editorialize! rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mTheRedPenOfDoom: see all the talk above. When all of the mainstream science calls the work pseudoscience, then the NPOV view of the article MUST call the work pseudoscience. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mRavensfire: This.  It would be a blatant POV to NOT mention that some of his views are far off the majority viewpoint and have been discredited. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mBarney the barney barney: , I understand you're new here so I've recommended you read the stuff at the top of this page.  Do not be surprised if a low level scientist (as Sheldrake was), starts making extraordinary claims without required evidence, that members of the scientific community call him out.  That's part of the scientific process.  Sheldrake's article is "biased" against him not because the editors are biased but because several prominent members of the scientific community are biased against nonsense. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mTom Butler: Barney, This is not about whether or not Sheldrake has been called out. See if you can stand back and take a look at the article as a whole. It is clearly an attack piece. Now consider what many of us have been working toward for Wikipedia for many years. The Wiki is too important to allow a few zealous editors to use it as a way of proving a person is wrong. That make any of us wanting to use Wikipedia as a reference look like idiots.
Either make the article neutral or I will put it up for deletion. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[36mBarney the barney barney: A neutral article on a heavily disparaged subject is going to look like an "attack piece".  Please stop edit warring. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[35mIantresman: @ "all of the mainstream science" does not call his work pseudoscience. In this context, "mainstream science" is a weasel word (unsupported attribution). There is no dispute that several individuals have called his work pseudoscience. There are also examples of academia who do not chacterise Sheldrake's work as pseudoscience, such as the University of Cambridge, the University of Edinburgh's Koestler Parapsychology Unit, the University of London's Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit, the University of Arizona's Center for Consciousness Center, the University of Northampton's Centre for the Study of Anomalous Psychological Processes, the UK's Open University, Binghamton University, NY,.
And then we have the peer-reviweed papers that examine Sheldrake's without prejudice, eg. in the Journal of Consciousness Studies (2011),, and, peer-reviewed papers by Sheldrake himself, eg. in The Journal of Science and Healing, And mentions in academic books such as the ''Encyclopedia of Creativity'' (Elsevier), rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mTheRedPenOfDoom: uhhh, like I said, all of the mainstream academics. that pseudo-scientists see him as one of their own, well that sells it right there. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mTom Butler: Well, there you have it; the reason this article is not balanced: the position some editors are taking is that scientists do think it is pseudoscience are writing in acceptable publications and the scientists who do not think it is pseudoscience are also pseudoscientists and therefore their opinion does not count.
Is that about right? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[33mà¶¢à¶´à·ƒ: The "Journal of Consciousness Studies" is a terrible source that is certainly not independent of the fantastical claims.
Hans-Peter Durr is normally described as "wacky" when it comes to his proposals on consciousness (similar to Roger Penrose). As such, we can safely dismiss his credulity as pseudoscientific.
So, no, you haven't actually been able to satisfy my request. Again, we need an independent source, not a fellow believer in magical quantum consciousness. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[33mà¶¢à¶´à·ƒ: It must be upsetting to those who are on the losing side of the argument, but essentially, Wikipedia's rules on reliable sourcing demand that we pay deference to those who are actually mainstream. Sorry. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mIantresman: Are you suggesting that all the academic institutions I listed above, are not mainstream, and if so, how you came to that conclusion? There seems to be a suggestion that anyone who investigates parapsychology without prejudice is by definition non-mainstream, and anyone who investigates parapsychology in order to disprove it, is mainstream? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[33mà¶¢à¶´à·ƒ: Are you honestly suggesting that morphic resonance is not a proposal by Sheldrake? That is, do you really want me to provide a source that Sheldrake suggested this idea himself? Because according to my dictionary, that's what "proposal" actually means. If you think it's not a "proposal", do you think it is an "idea" at least? rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[37mTumbleman: the only thing that is being lost here is the spirit of WP. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
