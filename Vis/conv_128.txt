{'text': 'So far, there\'s only one place that lists the date of death as December 22 - the NY Daily News.  Two problems with this: the article says "died December 22 in Bethlehem, Pa., Stern announced in a statement on Tuesday." - when Stern did not, in fact, announce an exact date; there\'s no date on the Stern page that the NYDN article links to, either.  Second, that date may well have been pulled from this wikipedia page - it was added, unsourced, by an anon IP at 01:20, 6 January 2016', 'username': 'Rockypedia', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}

We can keep slinging accusations of who\'s guessing on what, but burden of proof is on you to prove December 22 isn\'t correct.

There's a good bit of evidence that that's exactly what happened here, because while many other news sources reported Martin's death, only one of them listed an actual date of death, and that reporting came long after the Wikipedia edit in question. I'm not saying he definitely didn't die on Dec. 22 - I'm saying that until it's confirmed, that should not be listed as the date of death.", 'username': 'Rockypedia', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument', 'DH4: Repeated argument'], 'coordination_labels': []}

Those other cases Wikipedia:List_of_citogenesis_incidents serve as a reminder that we should be cautious about getting it right. If the December 22 date is so definitive, why didn\'t more media outlets publish it? TMZ is a pretty accurate source, and they didn\'t publish a date. Neither did any traditional news sources, such as USA Today. This NY Daily News article says "He passed away in early January", and that\'s the same source that you claim is so reliable. I\'m just saying that in this case, when Wikipedia may be used as a source for a subject that received minimal coverage, we should be very careful about perpetuating incorrect information.

I\'m asking you to give me a reason to believe it\'s a case like previous ones, you keep basically stating " it\'s happened before". Those we were able to prove, here we have not, except the assumption that they took their information from us. If they put "per Wikipedia, he died December 22", Id be in agreement, but since no cite to Wikipedia was made, we can\'t confirm or deny.
