{'text': "'The collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin''. Thats what defines Institutional Racism. I wrote of the failure of the church to provide services in canada to the ethnic children rendered into its care, not about the residential schools. You removed that and replaced it with plagarized material explaining the residential schools. The fact that the church ran the schools needed that backdrop to show the continued, ingrained racism, not of the individuals, but of the system that allowed social workers(gov't) to remove babies from mothers, children from their families, and deliver them to a chop shop (residential schools) where TB infected kids were bedded with healthy kids whom had no immunities, abused and neglected, and left dying at a higher rate than if they had been left alone in their pagan villages. The worst of the abuse was doled out to the ones who were not christians (by Clerics and staff). Stop trying, you cannot change the past. If you want to write about the schools, be my guest. I'm writing about '''institutional racism''' - the two are not the same", 'username': 'BeeCeePhoto', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}

{'text': 'Why are you so against putting your edits on the Canadian Indian residential school system Wikipedia page? The reason why I want you to add it to that page and other well-moderated pages is so that you can get feedback from other editors and there will be consensus regarding whether to include this in Wikipedia or not. It will also prevent an edit war, since it won\'t be one editor vs another editor. It will be a group of editors coming together. As I said before, if you can get other editors on your side, then I will let the edits stand. What really surprises me is that you rant about how people should know about the aboriginal experience in Canada, but you refuse to take the simple steps to tell anyone about it.\nThe thing is that you correctly point out that I "copied from another site", which is something I mentioned I did in my own comments. I copied from a well-moderated, relevant, well -sourced Wikipedia page. That\'s not only allowed, but indicative that I am trying to be consistent with the writing and style of other editors. In fact, I will do more copying and pasting from one of the Wikipedia policy pages:\nWikipedia is not a publisher of original thought Personal essays that state your particular feelings about a topic (rather than the opinions of experts). Although Wikipedia is supposed to compile human knowledge, it is not a vehicle to make personal opinions become part of such knowledge. In the unusual situation where the opinions of an individual are important enough to discuss, it is preferable to let other people write about them.\nWikipedia is not a soapbox or means of promotionA dvocacy, propaganda, or recruitment of any kind: commercial, political, scientific, religious, national, sports-related, or otherwise. An article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to describe the topic from a neutral point of view. You might wish to start a blog or visit a forum if you want to convince people of the merits of your opinions.\nOpinion pieces. Although some topics, particularly those concerning current affairs and politics, may stir passions and tempt people to "climb soapboxes" (for example, passionately advocate their pet point of view), Wikipedia is not the medium for this. Articles must be balanced to put entries, especially for current events, in a reasonable perspective, and represent a neutral point of view.\nI will start reverting your edits unless you start getting more feedback regarding your edits. I don\'t think they are well-written, but don\'t take my word for it. If an edit war occurs, then you may be blocked from doing any edits. However, don\'t worry. They don\'t take away your user page for starting edit wars or being disruptive. Think about it, why would they take away your user page for being disruptive? Isn\'t it better to block people who are making inappropriate edits', 'username': 'DivaNtrainin', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}

{'text': "Ok, if you are going to work on Institutional racism, then work on it. The entire page needs work on, so I am going to challenge you to start with the introduction and work down. One of my main problems is that your style of writing is frankly terrible, and if you work on the entire page, I think you are going to improve. For example, you randomly like to capitalize words for no apparent reason. You don't understand how to put in references to other Wikipedia pages, and you include weasel words. The reason I deleted your passage was because it seemed that my section and your section was the exact same topic, only yours seemed to be a random collection of ideas. I deleted it because we shouldn't have two sections on the same topic on the same Wikipedia page. Let me put it this way. I couldn't summarize your section into a sentence or two, because it seemed like you were going off on a tangent. So, here is my challenge, provide one of the two things:\n''Summarize what you are trying to say in a sentence or two. Don't worry about references. Just tell me what you are trying to say.'''\n''Tell me in one to two sentences, what general information you think was missing in my passage that needed to be added'''\nIf you provide this, other editors can help you figure out the best wording for this section.If you can't do this, its reflective that you are interested in an edit war.", 'username': 'DivaNtrainin', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument', 'DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic'], 'coordination_labels': []}

Leave it alone until another editor gets involved. You are actively WP:VAND the entry. You were not interested in the topic until I expanded the Canada section. You added two copied paragraphs and deleted the sourced piece. I don't see anything but a biased racism fact slant to your entry. I did change it (your entry) and added sources and correcting the introduced errors, but you keep returning your weasel entry and deleting the original. Step away, other editors will step up.

If you could run your editing by some other editors, they would agree that you need to work on your writing.

You don't understand the wide range of experiences and the complexities of the aboriginal residential school system. That's why I keep linking to a larger Wikipedia article, because this issue is larger than a short summary on this page. If you want to talk about racism, then here is my opinion: You are expressing a view that is similar to a lot of people who are racist against natives. Let's put the arguement as to who is racist aside,because no one will win that argument. Instead, give me something to work with, and I can help you improve your writing.
