{'text': 'I have amended the explanation of that song to indicate that the way it is often interpreted is not necessarily correct.  One may argue that an analysis of any one of her specific recordings or hit singles does not belong in a general biography about the pop superstar, but if that partial explanation is to remain, then my correction must too.  I ask Hullaballoo_Wolfowitz not to keep immediately reverting it without explanation.\nThe 1972 single "The Way of Love" \'\'has been presumed to be\'\' either about a woman expressing her love for another woman, or a woman breaking up with a gay male she loved ("What will you do/When he sets you free/Just the way that you/Said good-bye to me").  \'\'However, many contend that as the singer of the song she is imparting advice on matters of the heart to another woman in the second person, but then directs the line "Just the way that you said goodbye to me" at the man who recently left her, on which her advice is based.\'\'', 'username': 'SWLinPHX', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}

{'text': 'It is you Hullaballoo who have reverted the same text three times in an hour.  Either my addition should be included or the entire interpretation of the song should be deleted.  You continue to insist only one side (the common misconception) be represented. You are also disingenuous in your assertion that I engaged in cite breaking, as there were no cites to the original (and incomplete) analysis of the lyrics to begin with; I merely expanded and clarified.  Anyone can see that in the revision history.  Never did I insert my own text before a citation of a source.  Being a "Wiki-bully" or acting as if you own the rights to a page by deleting all edits that you don\'t personally approve is against TOS.

{'text': 'I think you should all consider these few items of note before including that passage on Cher\'s Wikipedia page:\n\'1) The song was not written nor first recorded by Cher.  It was written first with French lyrics in 1960.  It was first recorded in English by Kathy Kirby of the UK in 1965.  She employed the same pronoun use that is the basis of the debate over the interpretation.  So it has nothing to do with Cher being androgynous or "gender neutral".  Cher simply did not change the lyrics.  So should she be credited for them?\'\'\n\'2) It is very unlikely that a 1965 easy listening/adult contemporary song such as this was supposed to make any statement or reference to lesbianism or homosexuality in any way.  You are interpreting this with a 21st Century mentality.\'\'\n\'3) Vicki Carr included the song on an album which was produced by Snuff Garrett, the same man who produced this song for Cher.  He approved of the lyric being altered from the original Kathy Kirby (and later Cher) version to "What will you do when he sets you free?  Just the way that he said goodbye to me".  So after he produced Cher\'s recording he realized the confusion or "mistake" in the song and corrected it.\'\'\n\'4) Contrary to initial reaction, it was later understood that the original version was likely a woman who is suffering from her own recent jilting, and thus is giving this advice to another girl or woman.  She then, lamenting her own situation, turns to direct that last line to the man who left her ("Just the way that you said goodbye to me"), as he was on her mind the whole time she was giving the advice, which itself is based on this recent loss.\'\'\n\'5) Because Joe Viglione of Allmusic may have inferred the homosexual reference does not supersede all the evidence here.  Many, MANY songs are often misunderstood or misinterpreted at first by the listening public.\'\'\n\'6) The analysis of this (or any) one specific song does not really belong on a page that is about Cher in general.  It is too off-topic, even if she was the original recording artist or it had been written for her (and all the gender theories were emphatically true), but it was not.  This discussion belongs on the Wikipedia page for the song itself, which already exists.\'\'\n\'7) Finally, other than this dubious, weak and misguided reference, what other examples are there that Cher herself sang gender-neutral songs?   Can you cite any?  Having a deeper, contralto range does not in and of itself lend her songs to being construed as "androgynous".\'\'\nAnyone who is a Cher fan or Wikipedia aficionado should want only the most accurate and pertinent information to be included in its articles.  In light of all the above, I kindly urge you to reconsider.', 'username': 'SWLinPHX', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH7: Refuting the central point'], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
{'text': "I agree with items 1, 2 (although any of us, Wikipedia users, is interpreting the song), 3, 4 and 5, so I will remove the analysis. As for the items 6 and 7, the analysis of a specific song belongs to the artist's main article if it serves as an example to a fact, as seen in good and featured articles like Madonna (entertainer), Michael Jackson or David Bowie. I can name examples of what you asked, but it would not be valuable since Wikipedia only accepts referenced content. We can't discuss the androgyny in Cher vocals; if a reliable source like Allmusic published that, it belongs to the Music section of Cher's article, even with attribution.

I am currently learning to speak English fluently, so sorry for any mistakes.", 'username': 'Lordelliott', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Conceding / recanting']}
{'text': "Before removing Viglione's citation, I have a point: we know Cher wasn't the first to record the song, but her version was by far the most popular.
