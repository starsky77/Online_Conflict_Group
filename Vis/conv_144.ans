[31mMiradre: The Color of Crime rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMiradre: The report, from the New Century Foundation, as a source have been removed from the article. Please explain why. Reports from advocacy groups are not prohibited. It certainly passes a relevancy and notability criteria since it is widely cited in this area. The statistics of the report are from official statistics and reports in the scientific literature. If there is disagreement with a figure, then an opposing view should be stated with a source. Just attacking the author and not the content is a not valid ad hominem attack. As such, I propose the report should be added back. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mCordeliaNaismith: I don't think it's a reliable source. If you think it is, take it to the Reliable Sources noticeboard. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mCordeliaNaismith: Also, I see that a user has just removed the citations to The Color of Crime without removing the information from the source.  I've removed the now-unsourced material from the article. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMiradre: I may, but I would be interesting to hear your reason for why it is not a reliable source. Let me rephrase. We should not state that the report contains the WP:Truth on this matter but that as a notable view on this topic it should be included as per WP:NPOV. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mMaunus: It is not a reliable4 source because it is a report by a political advocacy group which does not live up to the standards of WP:RS or indeed to any academic standard. It was quite rightly removed. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mMiradre: The views of political advocacy groups are of course not prohibited in WP. As a notable view in this area it should be included. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mMaunus: You did not use it to source "views" but to support "facts" that is obviously not a correct use for such a source. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[31mMiradre: Reports from various advocacy groups often include research which is allowed in Wikipedia. We should make attribution clearer and state when a view regarding public policy is stated (although this was already done but maybe it could be clearer) and when it is reporting official statistics and scientific studies in this area. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mMaunus: I don't think so. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mMiradre: Why not? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mMaunus: Because we need to establish mainstream views in the article before we include fringe ones. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mMiradre: How is for example a figure regarding the risk of being in prison, based on official statistics, a fringe view? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mMaunus: It is not but advocacy groups are not trustworthy sources for statistical data. If you want to include the data get it from the original source or from a mainstream summary of it. We also don't use David irving's figures as the main source for numbers of holocaust victims. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mMiradre: Godwin's law. There is nothing prohibiting research from think-thanks and so on in Wikipedia. Yes, the attribution should be clearer, stating that this is NCF calculations based on official data, but otherwise I see no reason for excluding it. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mMaunus: I don't honestly care what kinds of reasons you see. Get a consensus without me and you can include it. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mMiradre: Wait, you are objecting regardless of reasons? It is a case of Wikipedia:I just don't like it? rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[34mMaunus: No it is a case of you not seeing any kind of reason in general, for which reason I don't need to take your "lack of seeing a reason" seriously. I am providing reasons - you don't see them. And then you say that its a case of IDON*TLIKEIT - more like a case of IDIDNTHEARIT from your side. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mMiradre: You did provide some reasons but they did not follow policy. Research from think-thanks, interest groups, and so on are not prohibited in Wikipedia. Maybe you should take a look at what you argue against. Have a look: rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mMaunus: I am not trying to "censor" your precious "white nationalist" viewpoint, but I am arguing that it is not a reliable source for statistics. And I am not the only one. Get a better source for the statistics. Write up a proposal for how you want to include the "view" of New Century Foundation then we can discuss that. rebuttal_labels:: DH0: Name calling/hostility, DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mMiradre: Again, there is no difference between them presenting a research figure or simply presenting a policy view. Obviously there should be attribution but there is no prohibition against "numbers" from such groups. If you agree on that I can certainly propose a text. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mMaunus: Again you IDIDN*THEARTHAT. Take it to the RS noticeboard. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH-1: Bailing out
[31mMiradre: Maybe I will. But lets try to resolve it here. Do you have a Wikipedia policy page that prohibits research numbers from think-thinks, special interest groups, and so on? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mMiradre: Anyway, I am not going to argue for this anymore. There are other sources for the data and arguments. They should be less susceptible to being rejected simply because of the authors so I will use them instead. Some already added. rebuttal_labels:: DH-1: Bailing out
