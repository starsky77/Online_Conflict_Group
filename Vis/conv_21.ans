[31mFÃ¦: Promotion of eugenics for low income and low IQ parents rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mFÃ¦: Young's article in September 2015 on "Progressive Eugenics" includes his proposal to provide free embryo screening to poor people and those with low intelligence: "why not offer it free of charge to parents on low incomes with below-average IQs?". Sources:

[32mPhilip Cross: The issue is clearly relevant for the article, but not yet suitable for the summary which is not intended to include material absent from the main article. Nor do sources suggest Young's recent resignation from the OfS board is linked with the clandestinely held eugenics conference at UCL, as was suggested in the additions I removed. While Young was present, sources so far are not suggesting he played an active role. Adding it to the summary was presumptive. As I say, it should be in the main article first before it is covered in the summary. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mFÃ¦: Glad we agree it's relevant. In the context of someone with some control over how schools are managed, Young's views on how we should use eugenics to possibly give the bottom 10% of society more intelligent children is enlightening. Equating being "in the bottom 10%" with having a genetic low IQ, is pretty informative of how Young thinks about children. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mEl Badboy!: @ Mr Cross. You removed the additions? Could I ask why specifically and what was the problem? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mPhilip Cross: I state the issue above. Another source. Incidentally, he ''was'' actively involved in the related conference in Toronto, which it would be best to concentrate on here, a few months after the University College London event, as well as the coverage of Young's ''Quadrant'' article. The UCL article does not yet have a passage on the the secret conference controversy. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mJ.M.Ike: Since the information has been added to the lede again, I thought I'd mention that I think there should be a section on this within the article. It does seem odd to include this content in the lede and not the main text. This controversy is definitely notable enough for it to merit mention within the article text and ought not to be removed. rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mWoodChopper: There are three other sources about the racist Eugenics conference in London.  , and . All three of these articles point out that a pedo called Emil O. W. Kirkegaard who has neo-Nazi views had attended this conference. rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
