{'text': 'WP:RSes disagree (particularly the English speaking ones which are more accessible to me) - I think it should be in - however I am not averse to modifications in language here (e.g. chilling effect) - if there are WP:RSes to back it up (while I might agree this is a chilling effect - i.e. perhaps local government being wary of sponsoring/participating in an event that would contain possible violations of the law - that\'s WP:OR by our part without a source saying so).At present, this event was fairly widely covered. The vast majority of the coverage we have on the new portions of the law (the 2018 amendment) are media-based (we did have a bunch of holocaust scholars speak up in op-eds in the media - but I don\'t think there is credible peer-review journal coverage yet - it is simply too new) - it is still in the "current event" realm.', 'username': 'Icewhiz', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
{'text': "The point is this is only speculate to be related to the new law. It would be one thing and totally relevant if someone was charged. But if someone spoke before a smaller audience because someone else didn't want to listen... this is business as usual. Honestly, new law or not, I expect the very same thing would happen anyway - the claim of '200,000' is controversial in Poland (and not only) and many people would complain and cause some trouble anyway. Currently we have 3:1 in favor of removing this section, so I think it should go. At best, could try to summarize it to a single sentence and include in some other relevant section; but this totally does not deserve a section of its own. |", 'username': 'Piotrus', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH4: Repeated argument'], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
