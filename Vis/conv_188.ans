[31mMrX: AC and the induction motor rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMrX: I have reworded a couple of sentences in this section for clarity, but removed this (in red) as WP:UNDUE:
The motor worked with a polyphase current  He received a US patent for the motor in May 1888.  rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMrX: In my opinion, this last sentence is tangential and not important to understanding Tesla. As long as we don't make peacock claims about Tesla being the first/best/biggest/baddest, then there is no reason to explain the history of alternating current in such detail. I took out the definition of polyphase, assuming that interested readers can click on the wiki link if they want to learn more.- rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mFountains of Bryn Mawr: Three reasons for the rewrite by me before your removal to talk.
MOS:JARGON requests that technical terms be defined in text in the article: do not force a reader to follow the link to understand a term. (Assume the reader is reading a hard copy with no wikilinks).
Readers will come to this article assuming Tesla invented AC (and the article currently does not tell them any different). The point in time in AC development should be explained. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mFountains of Bryn Mawr: The reason ''why'' AC was preferable/being developed has been in the article for a while and should still be there. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mAtlantictire: I have a version of that section that explains the advantages of AC right away in the first paragraph (long distance transmission, ready conversion to different voltages). I didn't post it, because I didn't want to edit war and I wasn't confident it wouldn't be reverted or re-revised. But yes, that is better. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMrX: Which "that" are you referring to?- rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMrX: @Fountains of Bryn Mawr: I'm flexible about the jargon, if others agree. I did consider rewording that part, for example replacing 'feeding' with 'supplying'. I can't get on board with the premise that people come to this article assuming that Tesla invented AC (unless they are electrical engineers, perhaps). I think people come here because they read or viewed videos that portray Tesla as a mad genius who made huge coils, that spewed 20 foot longs bolts of lightning, and that could alter space and time. I think Tesla's role in the commercialization of AC is important and historic, but I don't think it's a major theme for his biography.- rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mFountains of Bryn Mawr: Judging by whats on the number one viral site on the internet, The Oatmeal, in black and white in many many books, and every Tesla question I have seen on Yahoo Answers, a whole lot of people think Tesla invented AC. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mAtlantictire: You version. It's less misleading. There's no danger that anyone with at least a 5th grade reading comprehension will come away from that thinking Tesla invented AC. Sorry, I'm too fed up with this. Patience: gone. Gonna recuse myself for the evening from Wikipedia. rebuttal_labels:: DH-1: Bailing out
[31mMrX: Perhaps, but we have to rely on our reliable sources and follow the relative WEIGHT in those sources. Your quandary is that the many many books that claim Tesla invented AC, works directly against the content that you wish to include. The sentence, at least as written, is not faithful to the collective Tesla biographies, as far as I can tell. It also introduces a topic in a way that seems to rebut a claim that was never made, which teeters on the edge of WP:OR.
I hope we are not writing this article to address the positively poor information dispensed at various sites like Yahoo Answers, or various fan sites across the internet. Show me some scholarly mainstream debate about Tesla inventing versus not inventing AC, and I will reconsider my view on this. - rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mFountains of Bryn Mawr: My "quandary" is that we should state the obvious and define jargon. He worked in the ''formative years of electric power development'' (near the very beginning of AC development), its in the lead in short form, it should be in the body in long form. It should be there because of WP:OBVIOUS. We should follow WP:JARGON. We can skip stating his position in the development of AC if you want. Readers can always infer that from whats given, or yeah..... we would have to explain he did not blow up Tunguska, create free energy, have J P Morgan yelling "where do you put a meter on this thing?" at him, dematerialize a ship in Philadelphia, or build a particle beam weapon in his New York apartment in the 1930's (oops, do we say that? ;)). rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mAtlantictire: No,  FOBM, what you're proposing is misleading POV. Tesla designed and built the first practical AC induction motor. It really is that simple. , we may need to have a RfC on this as we did on Tesla's birthplace. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mMrX: The main issue I have with the parenthetical explanation of polyphase current is that it really doesn't work well to explain to the lay reader what it is. Anecdotally, I tried to explain this very concept to my neighbor a couple of days ago when a lightning storm cause one phase to cut out, causing our air conditioners (but not other appliances) to stop working. Their response was a blank stare of confusion. I would expect that our average reader does not even understand alternating current, so how could they be expected to understand 'out of phase current'? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mMrX: Since there is no claim in the article that Tesla invented AC, the most neutral presentation of the material would require omitting content about contemporaneous AC research and development. I'm open to an RfC, or perhaps others will join this discussion so that we can establish a clearer consensus.- rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mFountains of Bryn Mawr: Per WP:YESPOV and Check your facts no. It would not be a "true" statement and we do not ''state seriously contested assertions as facts'' (per policy). We could present the sides but that makes the section longer and go off topic. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mFountains of Bryn Mawr: I see agreement on "The reason why AC was preferable/being developed" / "Tesla's role in the commercialization of AC" / "advantages of AC" leading to the sentence "''At that time alternating current power systems were starting to be built in Europe and the US because of AC's advantages in long distance high voltage transmission''" or some form of that. '''Opposed''' to RfC because it would be an RfC on something clearly spelled out at WP:YESPOV. This is not the place to rehash Wikipedia policy. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mAtlantictire: ''Support''' RfC (if it comes to this) because this is the consensus among Carlson et al. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mFountains of Bryn Mawr: Carlson does not support first to "design" and no consensus amongst sources, way to many sources call this an independent co-invention (last two declare both designs not "practical"). rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mAtlantictire: I don't have time for this. Someone else? Re-read the entire passage upthread from Carlson. It's under the green hat.
If you want to waste your time reading through all those links FOBM just provided and explain to him how they don't at all support his claim that Tesla doesn't deserve credit for designing and building the first practical AC motor be my guest. I've been playing this game for almost a week now, and it's somebody else's turn. rebuttal_labels:: DH-1: Bailing out
[34mAtlantictire: I think we ought to state in the first paragraph what the AC fuss was all about. I would add information about the advantages of AC and take out the bit about the Peck Brown profit sharing agreement. We do learn 2 paragraphs later about the sums Brown and Peck negotiated for Tesla, and right now the priority is to understand "why AC" without overburdening the paragraph.
Here's how I'd re-write it:
In April 1887, Tesla formed the Tesla Electric Company, financed by New York attorney Charles F. Peck and Alfred S. Brown, the director of Western Union. They established a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan so he could work on his alternating current motor and other devices for power distribution. Unlike direct current, alternating current is readily converted to different voltages and is transmissible over long distances. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mFountains of Bryn Mawr: I checked references on the paragraph I was adding to and found them inaccurate. I rewrote the this paragraph (and reverted it back) because it is factually wrong. Per Carlson, Seifer and other reference checks, Brown was not "the director of Western Union", he just worked there (and helped to set up a rival company), Tesla worked on improvements for existing motors and generators, DC devices, AC devices, a Thermo-magnetic motor, etc - it was not just to work on AC, and they did not "share equally" in profits. AC was not the primary reason for the business venture (Peck was not particularly interested in AC). This article is a BIO to accurately describe Tesla, some ins and outs of his business relationships are part of that. rebuttal_labels::
