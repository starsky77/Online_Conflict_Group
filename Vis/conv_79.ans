[31mTucsonDavid: I have re added the arrest because I feel that removing it violates WP:NPOV. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mNymf: Why do you feel that an arrest warrant that is ''completely'' unrelated to WikiLeaks belongs in this article, and under '''legal status''' to boot? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mTucsonDavid: It falls under WP:NPOV. Also a CEO is the face of the company and it could be said that it is a result  of the recent leaks.Plus all possible sides should be include. I would not would like to put it up for discussion but I do know how to place the template. Sorry I can't explain my view in words very well. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mSmartse: See #Arrest of Assange being included in legal status. It would help to keep all discussion in the same place. Can I move this up into that section? rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mIanmacm: Please don't edit war on this. There is a consensus not to imply that Julian Assange's arrest on the rape charges is directly linked to the site's legal status. Also as mentioned, there is WP:CRYSTAL in this edit. Wikipedia is not a crystal ball, please stick to the facts.''''' ''''' rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mTucsonDavid: I have added a POV tag because it seams that some editor just want their side or nothing I feel a discussion is warranted. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mTucsonDavid: Yes go ahead. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mIanmacm: The legal status of WikiLeaks is a complex issue. The site is hosted legally in Sweden, and the rape charges are a POV fork. They do not belong in the "Legal status" section.''''' ''''' rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mSmartse: Unless you can provide some strong sources to indicate that his arrest is anything to do with wikileaks (not just speculating that it might be) then I can still see no reason to include this. I can't see what it has to do with NPOV, but if you disagree please explain why it is POV to keep this out of the article. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mIanmacm: Also, please bear in mind that this article is about the website WikiLeaks, not a BLP of Julian Assange. Material that relates specifically to Assange should be in his BLP, rather than here.''''' ''''' rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
