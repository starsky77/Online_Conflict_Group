[31mJytdog: A herb/an herb rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mJytdog: the community put WP:ENGVAR in place exactly because there is no rational way to resolve a style dispute like this.   The notion is that if English style X is established in article, don't change it without prior consensus.   Without that piece of the MOS in place, articles would be beset by endless edit wars over style issues that would then generate endless RfCs or other forms of DR that would become a time sink across the encyclopedia.  Please get consensus to change i; this is not something you can do unilaterally, much less across several articles. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mPorphyro: Hi , I am aware of WP:ENGVAR, and would like to point out to you the policy says that one should "use the variety found in the first post-stub revision that introduced an identifiable variety". In the case of this article, that is "a herb", which was introduced in the original article. Additionally, in the above discussion, it appears to me that what consensus there was, was formed on the side of "a herb". rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mJytdog: it is what it is and it already was "an herb" when the previous editor (now indeffed) starting messing with it. just leave it alone already. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mPorphyro: Be that as it may, per policy it should be "a herb" on this page, and your advice to "leave it alone" could just as easily be applied to yourself. I will leave the current wording for a few weeks to see if anyone else decides to weigh in, and intend to then change the page to align with policy. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mJytdog: It is '''impossible''' to get local consensus on this kind of thing, which is why ENGVAR exists.  Leave it alone, or waste the community's time with an RFC but stop wasting your time and mine making useless arguments here.  I don't care if it says "an " or "a" - what is not acceptable is messing with it. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mPorphyro: I don't really see the point of opening an RFC. We have an administrator's comment on this page clarifying that policy is for "a" and even indicating his intention to change it, which may have happened and been reverted. Such a change is exactly per the ENGVAR policy, we should change it and stick to it. This is not "messing with it". I suggest you allow such an edit to stick instead of reverting and we can draw a line under this matter. You've referred me to the policy twice in this thread; how about we follow it? Why is pointing out that it clearly delineates which version we should use here a "useless argument"? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mPorphyro: 3RR applies within a 24 hour period and I don't think is relevant. I admit that when I made those edits, I didn't realise it was actually a ENGVAR issue but rather just a mistake, hence my zeal in making the changes. You'll note that I have not reverted the Lemon Balm revert you made; I checked the history for the article and the initial stylisation was for "an herb" and so per policy that's what it should be. On this article, policy dictates it should be "a herb". I will note, though, that I have reverted your edit once, and you have reverted mine twice. This would put you closer to violating "3RR" than it would me, and my suggested edit is totally in line with established policy and administrator suggestion, as covered above. I think it is wrong to suggest that the onus is on me to get an RFC: you are the one pushing a point of view specifically against wikipedia policy. To emphasise: the ENGVAR policy exists to unamIbiguously resolve these debates and for this article, it should be "a herb".  I see no real arguments for the contrary, and for what it's worth, my having made policy-incorrect edits (in good faith), doesn't diminish the fact that policy is clear on this one. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mJytdog: I have warned you to walk away from being a style warrior and wasting everyone's time. You will do as you will. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mPorphyro: You are being the style warrior here on the side of "an herb", insisting on your viewpoint against policy. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mPorphyro: No one further has weighed in on this and so I am making the change in accordance with policy, as I have done on each of the herb-related pages that you noticed I had edited, reverting a few of them to the "an herb" style. Each of these articles is now in accordance with WP:ENGVAR. Please do not edit it without an RFC or DR. We are now within the spirit and letter of policy on each of these pages and I hope we can draw a line under this ridiculous matter. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
