{'text': 'Users Beamathan and Dbachmann have set out to change the target of this redirect (until now redirecting to Kosovo) to Kosovo#Republic of Kosovo, thus leading to a tiny section of this article. In my view, this is just another POV disruption, as this move pretends to alienate the republic from the region, as if users searching for "Republic of Kosovo" were supposed to be searching for a small note on what would be an unimportant detail about Kosovo. Not the case. Every matter regarding the Republic of Kosovo is related to Kosovo itself, like it or not, therefore users searching for "Republic of Kosovo" should be redirected to the top of this article.
