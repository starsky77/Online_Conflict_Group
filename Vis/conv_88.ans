[31mGeorge: Non-English source rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mGeorge: Per WP:NONENG, could I request that someone provide the text of the relevant pages from ''Keneged Kol HaSikuim'' in Hebrew, a work the article currently cites? Please also provide an English translation of the relevant pages. Thanks! ←   rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mJaakobou: Does the article use direct quotes? '''' rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mGeorge: Don't think so. ←   rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mGeorge: ''Edit''' - Oh, it looks like Nableezy requested the same thing earlier. Feel free to reply in either thread; I'll look for it either way. ←   rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mJaakobou: If you have a live link I might be willing to quote it. In general though, if the source is legit and the text is not a direct quote, then there shouldn't be a problem leaving it as is. Off course, an English replacement would be preferable. What's the content about anyways? '''' rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mGeorge: It's an offline source. I think Shuki added it as a reference, so hopefully they have access to it, or know where to find it. It doesn't really matter if the source is being used for a direct quote or not (per WP:NONENG, "When citing such a source without quoting it, the original and its translation should be provided if requested by other editors: this can be added to a footnote or the talk page."). I don't really care what language it is in, so long as a translation I can understand is provided. It's being cited for quite a few things - more than any other source currently in the article. The statements in which it is currently the only source being cited are:
[The name Psagot] expresses the hope that the new village will achieve a peak in settlement and study of the Torah.
In 1981, Ariel Sharon, then Israeli Minister of Defense, told Pinchas Wallerstein, head of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, that he would support initiatives to settle the area.
After the first families moved to the site, the Supreme Court of Israel ordered a freeze on further settlement activity in the wake of an Arab property claim that was later rejected. In the spring of 1982, fifteen trailer homes were brought to the site and building plans for 48 houses were approved by the Minister of Housing and Construction David Levy. ←   rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mShuki: The first two I recall are translations of short lines anyway, the last one is actually a summary of a few paragraphs. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mGeorge: I don't think it's necessary to provide the full pages in Hebrew and translate them (which could be a copyright violation), but if you can provide the Hebrew & English of those relevant sentences/paragraphs, that would be great. ←   rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mGeorge: Might also want to include the sentences/paragraphs that support the "Israeli Supreme Court confirms this" phrasing. I know it's been removed from the article, but I suspect it's something that editors are going to edit war over for a while. Cheers. ←   rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mShuki: Thanks for mentioning that. I think it's quite important to mention a freeze and eventual unfreeze outcome to that in the same paragraph. Removing it leaves the reader in suspense. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mShuki: הרעיון להקים במקום נקודת התיישבות היה של שר הביטחון אריאל שון שהציע לראש המועצה האיזורית מטה בנימין פנחס וולרשטיין: "אם תעלו על ההרף אעזור לכם לאכלס את המקום"
לאחר שעלו חמש המשפחות הראשוניות לפסגות, הקפיא בג"ץ את המשך ההתיישבות במקום.
בסופו של דבר נדחתה העתירה בחודש אדר תשמ"ב, ומשפחות ה"כולל" עברו מעפרה לפסגות.
I got the book now, provided some lines, anything specific wanted? rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mGeorge: I think just whatever is necessary to support the statements in the article attributed to the source. If the source was readily available in English online, I would just go and find the relevant sentences/paragraphs and read them to confirm that the source says what it's being cited for. Same thing here, just that I need someone with access to the book and a translator. ) ←   rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mNableezy: I have requested, multiple times now, that you quote and translate the material that backs up the lines ''In the spring of 1982, the supreme court dismissed the claim and this paved the way for a rapid expansion including an immediate fifteen trailer homes with the help of Uri Bar-On and another 48 housing starts approved by the Minister of Housing and Construction David Levy'' and ''and the Supreme Court of Israel confirms''. Please do so. '''''' - rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mShuki: In the end, you want me to transcribe the whole section, I'm sure that will have copyvio issues. I'm working to get access to the author/researcher and find out if he minds and if an English translation is planned that would be important for WP:Israeli Settlements that Carol wants to create. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mNableezy: Shuki, if you wish to use a Hebrew source you are required to provide original quotations and translations of the material you say supports what you put in an article. As you have refused to do so for almost 2 weeks now I will be removing the material sourced to this source unless you provide those quotations and translations. '''''' - rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mShuki: Relax, I haven't refused so stop lying. Like I said, I'm trying to locate the author, and it's not easy when my free time is not during regular working hours. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[36mNableezy: After weeks of not complying with a simple request, you say I am lying? Interesting. I expect that to be struck out or we might see another AE fun-filled weekend. '''''' - rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[34mShuki: You can deal with copyvio, I will not. I am getting closer to contacting the author like I have said and you refuse to AGF accusing me of refusing to cooperate. Go waste your weekend with AE and more frivolous , I intend to enjoy mine. rebuttal_labels:: DH-1: Bailing out, DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
