One thing that Wikipedia doesn\'t do is misrepresent fringe claims as if they had more credibility than they do.

{'text': 'Dgaw, I think you\'re conflating NPOV with "giving equal weight". Wikipedia tries to represent the balance of reliable sources. The view that there is global warming and that it is being caused by human activity is overwhelmingly supported by the sources that Wikipedia uses in matters of science. The view that there is a campaign (or movement) to undermine public trust in this research for non-scientific (ideological, commercial) reasons has, in comparison to any other view (for example, that people called derogatorily "denialists" have correctly identified a conspiracy in the scientific community to defraud), overwhelming representation in what Wikipedia would consider the best sources (academic books and articles). This cannot be disputed, and Wikipedia should not pretend otherwise. While the article should have dissenting voices such as can be represented in Wikipedia, it would not be NPOV to present both sides as equal. I am keen, as my previous edits to this talkpage show, for the article not explicitly to take sides, and to leave the door open that the view you mention is challenged by some people. However, that one side has overwhelming support in the scholarly community is not something that Wikipedia editors are making up through prejudice. Like it or not, global warming denialism qualifies, because so few genuine scientists support it, as fringe science, and campaigns by well-funded political organisations to promote it constitute a genuine phenomenon that has attracted respectable academic analytical attention.', 'username': 'VsevolodKrolikov', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'Hi VsevolodKrolikov; I agree that neutrality does not equal "giving equal weight", and I\'m not saying the article\'s non-neutrality is related to that. Neutrality require, however, that all articles be written as far as possible without bias.  As written, this article does not just describe the points of view of those who are party to the debate, it speaks with the voice of one side. That\'s its problem.\nYour comments about the scientific perspective on global warming are fairly put, but I think somewhat beside the point, because this article is not about climate science, or whether or not global warming exists, but about the political debate surrounding it.\nPOV in topic context.  For example, is the article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_of_Jesus written from a particular point of view?  Absolutely it is, but not inappropriately.

{'text': "Hi Jaymax, you make an interesting point. In fact, the article Resurrection_of_Jesus is ''not'' written from a particular point of view, as Wikipedia means that.  Quite the contrary, in fact, which is impressive considering how controversial religion is a subject.  The article has a neutral title, describes a belief in neutral language, and describes the details of that belief.  It states clearly that its describing a religious belief.  It doesn't take a position on whether the belief is correct.  It doesn't use language that is either critical or supportive of the belief.  It doesn't take positions on the possible motivations of those who hold the belief.  And it describes alternate views, also neutrally, and links out to more in depth articles on those beleifs.

A few things.  1) What is infuding?  2) The second sentence doesn\'t say "said to be associated", it says "has been associated".  3) Even if it did say "said to be associated", that would address a different point than my edit, the point of which is this: as written, the first sentence is making an assertion about the motives of "denialists" instead of making it clear it is those who use the term are making the assertion.  That runs counter to the principle of neutrality, to which we are all subject: Wikipedia doesn\'t make assertions, it reports the assertions of others in as neutral a tone as possible.

{'text': 'DGaw, might I suggest that these exchanges you are having in this section are being somewhat superseded by the discussion about the lede below? Some of us are keen to focus the topic of the article not simply on people who prominently are known for not accepting the consensus on climate, but on the pattern of denial that emerges from people associated with conservative think tanks (that have often received substantial funding from fossil fuel industrial interests), which crucially \'\'has been identified by scholarly sources\'\'. (As it stands, the lede certainly is unclear and potentially POV - it can be read to imply that all denial is for political or commercial gain.) So, for example, the phrase "has been associated with" becomes by definition correct, as it\'s that kind of opposition to climate change science that sources generally examine, not opposition everywhere at all times. In these sources, the difference between scientific scepticism and attempts to bypass or ape scientific procedures in the political goal of attacking AGW is made very clear. The lede as it stands does not make this distinction, and it\'s remiss that it does not. I recommend the Oreskes book (well, I\'m halfway through it now, so that far at least) as being very well written and very clear about the issue - which is non-science based, politically motivated denialism, not the minority opinions of legitimate scientists. (It\'s available on kindle for a dollar cheaper than the hardback). By this, I don\'t mean that the article should presume Oreskes and the many other writers who say much the same are correct in their analyses, but at the very least it should be clear about what their case is, and what is beyond reasonable doubt (such as the strong association between prominent denialism and conservative institutes, and these conservative institutes\' financial connection to fossil fuel companies.) Lumping all dissenters from the consensus as "deniers" is wrong, but it\'s also POV to describe all deniers as "skeptics", and POV to turn the uncontestable (such as Frederick Seitz\'s and S. Fred Singer\'s association with conservative institutes) into mere conjectures.', 'username': 'VsevolodKrolikov', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
