[31m87.9.30.140: 204.....i saw your writings in several talks.151...... is right.You answered with a lot of citations about gdp PPP to appear impressive to other people but not nominal gdp.According to IMF 2014 April  estimates italy with 2,171 trillions has a nominal gdp ranked 8th as reported in Italy article.Russia with 2,092 is only 9th.Time to set Russia 9th as nominal gdp (See  List of countries by past and future GDP (nominal).Without doubt other people will notice it (above all italian people).Please restore the 9th that was posted before aside the nominal gdp of Russia.It's ridiculous that 8th in Russia page.The real 8th according to IMF data is Italy,not Russia. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32m151.40.74.108: It's easy to realize that Russia page has been changed in the wrong way. Italy  article (you can see it clicking on Italy)shows Italy with a nominal gdp of 2,171 trillions $ while Russia has only 2,092 trillions $ according to IMF April data.So Italy is the tru 8th and Russia is only 9th.I suggest as soon as possible administrators to reset 9th aside russian nominal gdp as ranking.I even saw 87.... opinion that supported 151.... opinion was deleted in a vandalic way by somebody.Other people i think like 87.... will arrive above all from Italy to tell to administrators about this huge mistake(in fact it regards 2 articles both locked). As usual there are no correct actings.Time to change 8th with 9th for russian nominal gdp (before EWF will do that in September)).Please 204...don't use anymore to me "DEAD"..i'm alive.Thanks. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument

[31m129.178.88.82: Please don't make personal attacks. You're also discussing two different things, the sources you provide discuss Russian GDP at Purchasing Power Parity, while the IP above makes claims on GDP (nominal) - the two are related but not the same, so take that into account. That said, the IP is still wrong - Russia was 8th largest based on IMFs 2013 data, just like the article states. It's 9th largest based on 2014 data, but 2014 data is estimated (c'mon, there's still half the year left) and estimates like that are not typically used for ranking. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH5: Counterargument

[37mIryna Harpy: , do not use edit summaries to challenge editors on your purported 'crusade' against the reliability of the IMF for financial statistics. In the first instance, as already noted to you, it is used consistently throughout all articles for countries in Wikipedia. In the second instance, why have you chosen this as the ''only'' article to challenge use of IMF stats rather than have it discussed via an RS/N for the sake of parity? In the third place, abide by WP:BRD. It does not mean BOLD â†’ DELETE â†’ REVERT â†’ REVERT x ''ad infinitum''.
