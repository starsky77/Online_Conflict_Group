[31mPeacemaker67: We should fix the article from this point. I agree there is some undue weight, lack of balance, POV etc, but some of your above comments also suggest POV and un-wiki language. I propose to continue the process I have already started, adding properly sourced material and challenging all POV and unbalanced material. BTW, Cohen is a WP:RS, his work is supported by Hoare , and your comment on him is completely unjustified, his work is part of a series by a highly respected team. He is used as a source by many other authorities on the period. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mJuraj Budak: To my best knowledge, P. Cohen is not historian. He is a dentist, therefore an amateur. At its best, it's a tertiary source. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mPeacemaker67: That old chestnut again! The work is reliable, published and scholarly. Tomasevich was an economist by training, but he is one of the most authoritative sources on Yugoslavia in WW2. Give me a break. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH5: Counterargument
[31mPeacemaker67: Also, I cannot understand your English composition in a number of places. Please carefully check your comments so that others can understand what you are saying. For example, you meant 'weak' not 'week' when you mentioned Matkovic. Also, why is Matkovic 'weak'? rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic, DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mPeacemaker67: I am very concerned that you think that the description of Pavelic as a politician is somehow inappropriate. He was a member of a political party, represented it in the Yugoslav legislature and subsequently became the head of a Croatian government. He also practised law, which makes him a lawyer. He was also a terrorist. You don't get to choose which of his occupations are listed in the article, that is the opposite of NPOV. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mPeacemaker67: I withdraw my comments about Cohen, and have struck them through on that basis. At WP:RSN, User:Fifelfoo produced a review from an appropriate scholarly journal which definitely questioned its reliability, however, Marko Attila Hoare indicates on his blog his good opinion of Cohen and his book, and that's good enough for me. I believe it is reliable for some specific facts, but only if used very carefully, and only if taken to WP:RSN first. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mThewanderer: 'Genocide in Satellite Croatia'' by Edmond Paris is in no way, shape, or form a reliable source. There are multiple reasons for this:
The publisher, American Institute for Balkan Affairs, was a Serbian nationalist printing house based in Cleveland. Other authors printed by this group within a year of Paris' work include Lazo M Kostić (member of the Commissary Government under the Nazis) and Sergije M. Živanović (Chetnik colonel).
Edmond Paris was not a historian. Period. He was a "journalist" singularly known for his virulent anti-Catholic writing and his "history" of the NDH.
The work contains no primary references. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mJuraj Budak: Yes, that book (Genocide in Satellite Croatia) is a reliable source for being widely accepted by scholars as a reliable source. Just simple Google Book search gives a good insight about the book acceptance as a scholar source. This book has ample of primary resources: German and Yugoslav WWI archives documents, the war survivors' testimonies, H. Neubacher's Sonderauftrag Suedost 1940-1945, etc. The great German historian M. Broszat (Der Kroatische Ustascha Staat) quoted three times Paris. Make assessment of your statement as  did. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation

[31mPeacemaker67: What about Matkovic? Why is Matkovic weak? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mJuraj Budak: Matkovic is a provincial scholar which started his academic career at the age of 50. His book about Independent State of Croatia (ISC) is almost unknown to international academia and scholars. He is referenced in the article 23 (!!) times compared to world-renown scholar Martin Broszat (referenced only once!)  whose Der Kroatische Ustascha Staat is referenced in almost any serious work about the WWII and the Independent State of Croatia. Matkovic plays with "International recognition of the ISC" and "Establishment of the ISC borders". First of all, the ISC never had any sovereignity over the claimed territory for a) their bureaucracy never ever entered some of the claimed by ISC territories for being controlled by the Serbian Chetniks of Yugoslav Partisans b) being fully occupied by Germans and Italians who were above the ISC "laws" and c) the ISC was forced to fully pay the occupation cost to Italy and Germany. Broszat, as a serious scholar, did not pay any attention to the "sovereignity" of the ISC nor her "international recognitions". The maps of Balkans provided by this scholar show that the ISC was split 40%:60% between Italy and Germany. At the beginning of 1943 more than 40% of the ISC was firmly in the hands of the Yugoslav Partisans. All of this is not visible in that Matkovic's book. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mJuraj Budak: My Croatia is dignity, honesty, justice, and pride, which is not Pavelic's ISC nor his HOP which gets 0.1% of the current Croatian population support. You cannot be neutral and honest, neutral and just. You can be only honest and just, then neutral within the limits of honesty and justice. This is an encyclopaedia (amateuristic and naive, but still encyclopaedia), not an Ustashe blog. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mPeacemaker67: ''Comment by User:Peacemaker67''' rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mPeacemaker67: ''Opposed'''. The proposal to return to a version of this article from two years ago is not appropriate because the 2010 version is itself full of grammatical and factual errors, is inconsistent with multiple WP policies such as WP:LEAD, WP:NPOV and WP:LABEL and needs lot of work itself. For example, the 2010 version has citations from the 'pavelic papers' and a self-published web book, uses the discredited '750,000 killed at Jasenovac' figure, is all over the place chronology-wise, and is generally pretty bad. This appears to be an attempt to remove, in one fell swoop, all material that this editor considers is contrary to some personal sense of justice and honesty that they believe should be reflected in this article (see comment immediately above). This attitude is not appropriate for WP, which this editor states is 'amateuristic and naive'. I have commenced working to get this article up to WP standard, potentially to get it to FAC, and have already taken sources to WP:RSN, discussed usage of WP:LABELs with other editors and have made properly sourced edits. I welcome others who also wish improve the article, but this 'back to the future' approach to revising the article is a retrograde step in my view. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mJuraj Budak: ''Comment'''. Not a single problem related to the 2010 article version was ever addressed or discussed. One user started changing that version without justifying his/her changes. Pavelic Papers are not 'a self-published web book', rather a collection of the WWII time American Counterintelligence Corps reports about Pavelic which are accepted by scholars as valuable sources. ''... uses the discredited '750,000 killed at Jasenovac'', it's the Yugoslav government estimate referenced by many historians, among them by Martin Broszat. Other disqualifications are arbitrary for having all the 2010 version strictly covered by credible and scholarly accepted references. No one complained about the grammar or the factual accuracy. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mPeacemaker67: I wasn't on WP in 2010 or I would have been on here doing just that. I didn't say the 'pavelic papers' were a self-published web book, they are primary source material. The web book is separate. The 100,000 figure for Jasenovac is not definitive, but it is the best approximation based on current evidence. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mThewanderer: Matkovic is one of the preeminent historians of 20th century Croatian history, and your criticisms of his work seem to speak to your own POV rather than the unreliability of him as a source. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Stating your stance
[34mThewanderer: -International recognition and establishment of the NDH borders: The NDH was internationally recognized by fellow Axis members, de facto recognized by several neutral states, and had low-level relations with others. The NDH had legal settled borders with all of its neighbours, recognized internationally by those states with which the NDH maintained recognition. How is writing about any of this POV? Matkovic and other contemporary historians have studied this because the Cold War/communist period historiography summarily ignored these topics. They are obviously important. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mThewanderer: Polemics about some inconsequential political party have absolutely nothing to with this article and should be avoided in the future if you'd like to be taken seriously. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mThewanderer: The 750,000 figure relates to all casualties in Yugoslavia as a result of the Axis forces. The same list contains 59,188 people killed at Jasenovac. Of course Martin Broszat wouldn't know this, because he '''never even saw the list''' as it was only published in 1989. Any historians who are reporting this now must be pretty awful at their job, as this is common contemporary knowledge. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[36m68.98.165.98: ''Go back to the 2010 version'''. Fix the broken links, improve grammar where necessary, remove the 'statesman' (statesman my foot!) from the info box. The Encyclopedia of the holocaust accepts 600,000 deaths in the Jasenovac konzlager. Croatian Ustashi did not left any bookkeeping of the Jasenovac inmates deaths. They destroyed any evidence they could destroy, for being vicious and true criminals. All we have are various estimates and all the estimates must be regarded equal and with respect. The victimized people there have the full right to estimate the number of those who died there. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mPeacemaker67: Please. What POV rot. The 'statesman' reference was one of the first things I removed. The 600,000 deaths at Jasenovac isn't even in the mainstream scholarly historiography these days, give me a break. The academic consensus is around 300,000 Serbs in the whole NDH. This stuff is as bad as glorifying Pavelic. I've already started getting rid of unreliable sources and material and adding properly sourced material, this RfC is pointless and POV. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH0: Name calling/hostility, DH5: Counterargument
[35mPotočnik: Ramet said it best: "The figure of more than a million dead is already horrific. Subsequent claims that 700,000 Serbs died at Jasenovac alone make a mockery of the sufferings of all of Yugoslavia's peoples and reduce the tabulation of the dead to absurdity." ◅ rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation

[31mPeacemaker67: Since this proposal was made, there have been over 150 edits of this article by 10 different users, almost all of which have made improvements. The article is already significantly improved from its state on 29 August. There is still much to do.

[31mPeacemaker67: Juraj Budak, if you do not want your shopping list of complaints about this article addressed, you are going about it the right way. I asked for your permission to deal with your comments in the way I did (line by line), and after over two weeks with no response from you, I reasonably assumed that I could go ahead. You have now removed all of my comments and restored the tagging of the article. This makes it appear no-one has attempted to address your concerns. Not only is it poor wikibehaviour, but it is counterproductive in terms of improving the article. There is no consensus to return this article to its state in 2010, so drop the stick and try improving it yourself instead of whingeing about it. rebuttal_labels:: DH0: Name calling/hostility, DH5: Counterargument

[31mPeacemaker67: Given what Timbouctou has said, I think we should be pretty circumspect about using this source for anything important, particularly opinion-type material, that isn't corroborated elsewhere.
