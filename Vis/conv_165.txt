That is a long term plan that has been advancing steadily, but has never succeeded. In 1912 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himara_revolt_of_1912) a small group of men, few days before Albania declares independence from the Ottoman Empire, hurry up and raise the Greek flag and a new vorioepirote flag (the latter one has both Greek flag elements (colors, pattern) and Albanian flag elements (double headed eagle)). They tried to create a new identity, Northern Epirus, part of Greece. They were unsuccessful though, as they did not get support from the population and Himara was joined to the rest of Albania, not Greece, or autonomous/independent. However, the struggle of these men and the state who financed them carries on. The propaganda continues, the separatist movement is alive. The census of 2011 clarifies the population composition though, only 24.56% declare themselves as Greek. Here included the ones that are 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 Greek in lineage.

{'text': 'Elsie\'s bibliographical dictionary does state he was born in Vuno. Vuno is identified as a Orthodox Albanian speaking village within the wider Himara area (Nitsiakos, Vassilis (2010). \'\'On the border: Transborder mobility, ethnic groups and boundaries along the Albanian-Greek frontier\'\'. LIT Verlag. p. 99. "According to the latest census in the area, the Greek-speaking population is larger but not necessarily continuous and concentrated. The exclusively Greek-speaking villages, apart from Himarë, are Queparo Siperme, Dhërmi and Palasë. The rest are inhabited by Albanian-speaking Orthodox Christians (Kallivretakis 1995:25-58); Kallivretakis, Leonidas (1995).

Regarding Orthodox Albanian speaking people in general though as they have been “between identities” of either choosing the Albanian linguistic one over one that gives them religious commonalty with the Greeks (and thus a common ethnic identity according to some)  over the past 150 years, Koleka’s identification as “Greek” by Petiffer may(and I stress this word may) suffice. This matter is also interesting considering that Koleka is the uncle of Edi Rama. Spiro’s sister is Edi’s mum. Dare I say it, I wonder would we say that Edi Rama is a “Greek” too?

{'text': "Resnjari, I need to reply to this. Speaking Greek does not make you Greek, just as speaking English does not make us British or American. Tomorrow perhaps our grandchildren will speak Mandarin, so it does not really tell much about someones lineage. Also when you mention Christian Orthodoxy it is important to emphasize that these is Albanian Orthodoxy and Greek Orthodoxy.They are not one and this is a very important distinction, although it might seem minor at fist sight. As you probably know, Albanians are not very religious people, so religion is not a good criteria to divide them in groups. There are exceptions to this though, but it is common to find Albanians of different religions and regions that have mixed with one another. Remember that Ali Pasha's wife Vasiliqi was Christian whereas he was muslim himself. Similar examples you will find everywhere and they are a sign of a modern society (signs of open-mindedness, tolerance, mobility). Coming back to the subject person. Spiro Thoma Koleka was not Greek, neither part of a minority. it will be impossible for anyone to prove Spiros Greek lineage because it is just a myth. For your info, it is very difficult to find an ethnic Greek (note the word Greek, I am not saying Greek speaking) in the village of Vuno. There are many in Dhermi and in some neighborhoods of the other villages, but in Vuno there are more polar bears than ethnic Greeks! Until recently many Albanians have taken the Greek passport because it was very convenient to be a member of the EU if you are Albanian. You got to travel freely, work in the EU area, get state assistance in case of unemployment, healthcare covered etc. So, for a poor Albanian working all day for 300€ a month, it was not a bad thing to have an additional passport. Also many older people have gotten a Greek passport and get a free pension that is higher than the average salary in Albania (no wonder how the Greek state has a black hole of 300 Billion Euros, they have been giving away free money all over the place). Anyway, getting the passport does not make you ethnic Greek, it just makes you ALSO a Greek CITIZEN, besides Albanian. Dual citizenship in Albania is allowed, so who am I to say that it is bad.

As in your comment that Nitsiakos states that some people identify as Northern Epirote is problematic, especially regarding Vuno. He also has stated that some Muslims also identify with that tag. In the book \'\'On the border\'\' he has made the reference that when Orthodox Albanians said some of that "Northern Epriote" stuff to him, they where playing around with it and being ambivalent (p.315. Those who live in Greece describe themselves as Greeks from Northern Epirus, while those who stayed in Albania are integrated into the Albanian Christian Orthodox population; after 1990 the “play” with the ambivalence of the term “Northern Epirote”; in Greece to be “Northern Epirote” means to be Greek.) Be aware of that too in current day contexts. I also have the book. There has been no wide ranging study about the changes that have occurred in southern Albania due to migration to Greece, the church run by a Greek hierarchy and so on. Kallivretakis is the last peer reviewed study of that kind and it was done in the 1990s.  As for Greek sources mentioning Vuno supporting Greek bands. True. Muslim Albanian ones supported Ottoman ones. So. Did people in Vuno solely do so because they \'\'felt\'\' "ethnically" Greek or because they felt a kinship due to shared Orthodoxy? A similar question could be asked of Muslim Albanians of the time. Also, parts of the Himara area was Albanianised as much as it was Hellenised. Greek schools operated in Orthodox Albanian villages in the latter part of the 19th century. Greek identity as understood today amongst them was not present prior to these events of the late nineteenth century. Being identified as Greek just meant Orthodox in past times. In the age of nationalisms, it acquired new national affiliation overtones.  The only Greek speaking villages in the area were and are Dhermi, Himara, Palasa and one of the Qeparo\'s.

In some villages of Himara the presence of grecophiles has increased over the years, many people have acquired Greek names and passports, however their family roots are very easy to uncover and the absolute majority is Albanian.
