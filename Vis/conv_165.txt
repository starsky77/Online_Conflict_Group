Actually, it does not apply here at all, because \'\'the content that I added\'\' does not violate this policy, as \'\'the content itself\'\' is not advocacy, propaganda, recruitment, et cetera.

{'text': 'Regarding weight, the sources do discuss life extension at depth. Let me give you some quotes.\nThe piece from \'\'The Telegraph\'\' has a lengthy paragraph on just life extension:\nThe discussion with political analyst Roland Benedikter in the \'\'Heise Online\'\' article is difficult for me to parse, because I cannot read German, though he seems to talk about life extension multiple times. However, his interview in \'\'Leftist Review\'\' is in English. In that article, he identifies "three important developmental steps, that some consider milestones on the way to \'transhumanism\'". The first, he says, is Google\'s Calico project. He has this to say:\nThe second identified step is the United States\'s BRAIN initiative. The third, he says, is Istvan\'s Transhumanist Party. Benedikter states:\nIt admittedly takes a bit of synthesis to connect Istvan\'s party to Calico\'s mission, but combining this information with that of the other sources makes the link clear.\nThe \'\'Popular Science\'\' states this:\nMore depth is reached in the interviews with Istvan. I agree that less weight should be given to his words, but they are not weightless, as the interviews are conducted and curated by professional journalists and published in reliable publications under editorial oversight – the staff choose what to publish. Even articles by Istvan him should be considered, because (for better or for worse) they still drive public awareness and conversation.\nIs this not enough for one mention in passing?', 'username': 'Haptic-feedback', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}
