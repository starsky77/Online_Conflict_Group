[31mJasper Deng: Mathematics section rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mJasper Deng: However obvious these results might be, I do not believe this section falls under WP:CALC, and therefore should not be included. It takes more than a few direct arithmetic calculations to arrive at them, and readers have to be able to verify the results themselves, which is nontrivial here. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mUnscintillating: Why shouldn't this fall under WP:CALC?Â  I didn't even use a calculator.Â  My recollection from WT:V is that this is not pushing the limits of verifiability under WP:CALC.Â  I'd support removing the claimed win rate until we have a decent source.Â  rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mUnscintillating: I see that I responded here without knowing that you've created your own version of the article.Â  Your edit comment complains that the win rate, a statement with a "citation needed" tag, doesn't fall within WP:CALC.Â  Of course not, that is a straw man argument.Â  rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mLynton1: @ Jasper Deng: As things stand, you have deleted the entire section. You imply the results are obvious (I agree) but then you imply they are difficult to verify (I disagree). All the results are verifiable and I have supporting screenshots which I will add to the section when it is reinstated. I also have a screenshot to support my original claim that a win rate of 56%+ is achievable over a run of 100 games. A lot of community effort has been invested in this concise and well-written section. It is a beautiful, and rigorous, piece that adds significantly to the understanding of Microsoft Hearts. I disagree with your action to remove it. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mLynton1: @Unscintillating: Thank you for entering into this discussion. Please note: Jasper has deleted the entire Mathematics section. I trust our good reason will prevail in having the section re-instated. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mUnscintillating: Please use four tildes (~~~~) at the end of each post you make on a talk page for attribution.Â  That is how we sign our posts.Â  Thank you, rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[32mUnscintillating: I gave Jaspar a chance to respond, but he has disengaged for the moment.Â  One point he clearly wanted was to not use the win rate, something I can support.Â  However, for the record here on the talk page, Linton1 has told me on my talk page that he collected data over 7000 games and that the win rate was 56%.Â  While not a WP:RS, is still a source of information for editors to consider (see WP:Inaccuracy).If I thought Jaspar would object to a reasonable next edit restoring most of the section, I'd go back to the consensus version of the article first.Â  But he has disengaged and I kinda prefer the latest revision that mentions two of the shortest games.Â  So I will try restoring that version, but without the win rate.Â  rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mLynton1: @Unscintillating, @ Jasper Deng:  I have now figured out how to post images. Please refer to my screenshot as verification of an achievable win rate of 56%. I also have other screenshots illustrating other claims made in the section.

[31mJasper Deng: I strongly oppose the inclusion of any mathematical analysis of the game unless and until reliable sources are found that perform the analysis. There has never been a consensus that game theory falls under WP:CALC, and as I keep emphasizing, nor can the derivation be of the form "3 times 5 equals 15". Similarly, we cannot include the win rate because for all we know, that image could have been doctored (just being the devil's advocate, not saying you did), which is why user-uploaded images are not considered reliable sources. Another thing to consider is WP:DUE. If no reliable sources have reported on it, then we should not give it any weight. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mUnscintillating: You've got some policy words, but don't seem to know how they apply.Â  "3 times 5 equals 15" requires nothing above high school math.Â  Going to the library is not original research.Â  Reading for meaning is not original research.Â  Yes, I don't support using the screenshot on the Article page, but I've already directed editor's attention to WP:Inaccuracy.Â  Due weight is a matter of editorial judgment.Â  I'm not really sure what your issue is.Â  rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mJasper Deng: No, I certainly do know how to apply them. If you read my comment carefully, my point is that the conclusions presented in the section are ''not'' of the form "3 times 5 equals 15". "Reading for meaning" is not a meaningful phrase, and it's besides the point that due weight is a matter of editorial judgement: my judgement as an editor is that the section is undue weight. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mJasper Deng: Once again, I am not. Please do not make presumptions about what I am or what I am not, this is the second time such a supposition has been incorrect. Things like win rate, longest possible game, shortest possible game, best play, and what not are pretty much game theory. And please refrain from labelling my removal "molestation" (as implied by your use of the term "unmolested"). The facts are ''not'' verifiable by those who do not know sufficient math. It doesn't matter how long it was in the article. Wikipedia policy is what matters. Wikipedia used to be about "verifiability, not truth". rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Repeated argument
[31mJasper Deng: You have also edited this section, please chime in. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mLynton1: @Jasper I have removed my reference to molestation -). I understood Game Theory to mean "the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers" (Wikipedia). As such this discussion may possibly come under Game Theory, but not the original section being discussed - which only introduces probability theory. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mLynton1: @Jasper: You are confused in your analysis. The section has nothing to do with Game theory. So far, the mathematical ideas are very basic (although I would personally love to see more). There is nothing controversial here. There is no slander. The facts are verifiable. The section is a serious attempt to extend knowledge in an otherwise esoteric domain. It adds a lot to the article and detracts nothing. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mRenamed user 2560613081: Hello, Jasper. It's been a long time. I feel I am losing touch with the old guard. (Well, except FleetCommand, with whom I might not mind losing touch!) rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mRenamed user 2560613081: Yes, I reverted the section once: revision 800729830. I usually revert when I see contributions that amount to patent nonsense. I cannot possibly fix these myself and a reversion is usually educational. An editor, be it , myself or anyone else, must always preview â€“ or at least review â€“ his own edit. Lynton1 did not realize that his contribution is broken and is not rendered as he intended. I did.
You see, I (and nobody else) care to what extent WP:CALC is stretched as long as the explanation is clear, conscise and well-worded. (Believe me, you wouldn't.) This contribution was the opposite: I read the first paragraph, understood nothing, and run into "does provide a beautiful symmetry", which is subjective, contains peacock terms and forbidden in Wikipedia. On the top of it, I ran into a broken image. (Wikipedia does not display an image from an external source. We take the use of non-free images very seriously.) And when I load it in another tab manually, I don't see symmetry (beautiful or otherwise) but congruity. Traversing the subsequent sentences is like crossing a minefield. I run into:
probability unknown (then how do you know it?)
citation to be provided (in plain text)
 (broken template)
this is a truly beautiful scenario with an incalculable probability? Are there any super quants out there to calculate this?! (what iritates and confuses me the most is the question mark! While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, in the case, the beholder's eye isn't certain and the beholder himself sees fit to write this incertainty multiply incertainty.)
In practice, a good player can achieve a win-rate of 57%+ (player vs computer over 100 games). A win rate of 56% has been verified by an addict with a continuous recorded game history exceeding 7000 games. This sentence has done a superb job of doing exactly what must '''NOT''' be done in Wikipedia, as mandated by WP:5P.
And then,  goes ahead and counter-reverts my reversion, without an edit summary, as if I am a vandal!
has put up a valiant effort to restore the low quality contents but unfortunately, the quality of the result is so poor, that I am sure if Unscintillating had reviewed, he'd have rejected it.
Best regards, rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mJasper Deng: Whatever you call it, it's not sufficiently trivial to fall under WP:CALC (and probability theory firmly doesn't, in my opinion).  I think both of us should work on toning down our comments, we shouldn't WP:BITE Lynton1. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH4: Repeated argument
[36mRenamed user 2560613081: Hello again. ) rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mRenamed user 2560613081: FleetCommand warned me you might say something like that! Being gracious to newcomer becomes the most difficult when they commit a huge mistake, e.g. spend hours writing a section that runs afoul of Wikipedia's fundamental policies. When you try to tell them euphemistically, they mistake it for an attack, because they think they are (to a very good degree) right. In such cases, treating the situation is best done like ripping a band aid: Do it quick! In other words, be consice, frank, and to the point, but not obnoxious.
When Lython1 reverted me without an edit summary, I neither engaged in edit war, nor complained, nor reported him for rudeness. I wouldn't have written the complaint above if you hadn't asked me to chime in. I would have waited more and then would have broken it to him after a while.

[32mUnscintillating: Jaspar Deng has not been able to provide any definition of WP:CALC, so he is currently arguing from personal opinion.Â  rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mJasper Deng: Because I don't need to recite a definition that I'm using and linking to.  Please stop misspelling my username (there is only one "a" in it). And I am not arguing from personal opinion: the simple fact is that as this does not fall under "basic arithmetic", per WP:V, the burden is on you (as one of those who wants to keep the content), not me, to illustrate that this is a "routine" calculation and to obtain consensus that it is an appropriate reflection of sources, which you have not. I shouldn't need to be this precise anyways. This isn't a legal argument. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mUnscintillating: So your position is that it is correct because I am wikilawyering?Â  That is your position's summation?Â  That's not arguing with the force of reason, that is evidence that you think that your position cannot stand without adding an ''ad hominem''.Â  rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mUnscintillating: Once again your post uses policy words such as "burden" without a sense that these are anything other than superficial arguments.Â  WP:Arguments to avoid discusses the problem with "just pointing at a policy".Â  "While merely citing a policy or guideline may give other editors a clue as to what the reasoning is, it does not explain specifically how the policy applies to the discussion at hand."Â  rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
