[31m85.255.233.221: Hello. I am not a single purpose account. I am an IP user which are just as legit as any one with a registered user on wikipedia. IP users make up the major contributors of wikipedia and as IPs change their contributions get lost into previous IPs, so just because I edited this article does not mean that your personal experiences should take precedence over mine. What you are saying is all your original research while I gave a reference. I am also searching for more. I am infact giving away my location with my IP while you are the one anonymous. So let's not discredit each other and work based on references. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mScope creep: Dear IP 85.255.233.221, It wasn't you that I was referring to. It was the SPA account that came in, and immediately reverted the article twice, and had to be warned by an admin. I wasn't you. I understand the reasons for IP users, and welcome their work, and participation. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34m82.163.113.33: @, there's seems to be some confusion with the IP 85.255.233.221 & 95.210.221. From the previous section Talk:Dan_Wagner#...founder_phrase, they seemed to be interchanging in the conversation thread. WP:QUACK? rebuttal_labels:: 
[36m95.210.221.6: Just because my IP automatically switched (IPs do that!) doesn't mean that I am trying to look like more than one person. The network automatically changes IP some times. IP 85 and 95 above are both me. Please assume good faith and stay on topic! rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[34m82.163.113.33: Please forgive my incessant questions. This page has a history of WP:SOCKING, most recently  was banned for such.  had quite a history with this article and was a major contributor. Your POV is very similar to  and other previously banned/warned editors/IP's. You yourself have been warned for non consensus based updates to the article. It makes me wonder if WP:QUACK is applicable. Also, in the previous section you stated ''''I am not even a vodafone customer, my mobile provider is SFR in France.'''' - in that case, why did your IP change to a vodafone IP? Again, please forgive all the questions, I want to assume good faith editing/suggestions by yourself so we can all work together to make this article as accurate as possible and worthy of Wikipedia. This is why I defer to senior editors when it comes to editing of the article. I look forward to your continued contributions. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36m95.210.221.6: I have no idea who the ISP assigns the IP addresses and whose IPs they use which is why I have simply mentioned and owned my IPs. None of the other IPs or users belong to me and I shall not be accused of being them any more than you shall be accused of being one of them. I will ignore all your further comments regarding this matter so that this debate on the topic is not deviated so please dont waste your time asking me more incessant questions. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[36m95.210.221.6: I will be adding more references here in time. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36m95.210.221.6: Back to topic, I said I would be bringing in more references as I am not in favour of trimming valid facts from wikipedia though I support writing the articles in neutral way and not advertising any specific party. I gave some references before and there are more references I found from the library and I am sending scanned copies of the same for your review. That settles my support of including the claim that he was in fact the founder (or pioneer) of British e-commerce. The article from Marketing in 1988 states 'MAID has built a unique technology platform that allows articles to be purchased using computers. Mr Wagner has pioneered the technology to take payment in this way....' (obviously in 1988 ecommerce wasn't even a term that had been invented but the quote is clear) and the second article is from the UK national newspaper the Guardian dated May 1995 which says ''...(he) sees where the information highway is headed before anyone else has dreamed up the phrase' and '...ten years later, widely regarded as having invented electronic commerce, he launches his pioneering company.....'. I have done enough for my burden of proof as far as WP:V goes by giving reliable sources. Now if any one wants to read more on the topic, it is up to them to go to a library - but from my end, for some verification of the facts, I am giving the historical references for your reading as a courtesy and not just their citation details. You can see the scanned copies on the following links: Marketing Mag - May 1988 https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8CxFjCGp3NEWlE2eGphSEtaajA and The Guardian Newspaper - May 1995 https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8CxFjCGp3NEWlU0ZVlfTGMwd0U rebuttal_labels:: 
[34m82.163.113.33: As I posted in the previous section, Thompson Holidays UK launched a b2b e-commerce site 3 years prior to MAID, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce. The same link states Gateshead SIS & Tesco provided a b2c e-commerce offering in 1984, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24091393, Jane Snowball being credited as the first b2c purchase. The articles presented don't justify reinstating the 'founder of British e-commerce' statement. As this about reaching a consensus I'd like to hear the opinions of , ,  &  opinion. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[35mYak shaving: FYI, this is my newly registered account. I have previously posted from IP  & . For the benefit of other editors, I found a convenient cache of newspaper clippings relating to the subject here, https://web.archive.org/web/20160402055022/http://brightstation.com/press.ht rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[36m95.210.221.6: You are synthesizing your own opinion from the ecommerce wikipedia article and other references. None of them state or argue that Dan Wagner was not the founder of British ecommerce. They might mention other similar services but saying that Dan (Marketing Mag - May 1988 https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8CxFjCGp3NEWlE2eGphSEtaajA and The Guardian Newspaper - May 1995 https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8CxFjCGp3NEWlU0ZVlfTGMwd0U) called (or credited) Dan Wagner the founder of British ecommerce will be an indisputable statement. Because I did provide references that did call him that. Now, this can be said in a more neutral way as I stated. Such technologies evolve and may be pioneered in multiple ways. That does not negate my argument in any way. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mYak shaving: Nothing you provided states 'founder of British ecommerce'. I've presented you and other editors with information showing that the subject was not the first to do 'ecommerce' in Britain. Also according to this https://www.brightstation.com/maid, the product wasn't launched until 1985, the business was formed in 1984. Given all of this the current intro 'He created MAID, '''one of the first''' internet online information platforms in 1984' is fair although the date is debatable.
I've revert another WP:NONCON change by IP 95.210.221.6. Please discuss suggested changes on this page for all editors to review and agree. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[33mMelcous: I've been asked to comment again - for now I'll just say that I do not think it has been demonstrated that "the founder of British ecommerce" is a verifiable and valid claim and do not support it being re-inserted in the article. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36m95.210.221.6: Yak, your comments are original research. Wikipedia rules require us to say what reliable resources state. We are not allowed to do our own research on who is infact the founder or who started such a business first. That would be WP:TRUTH of your understanding and should not be a part of the discussion here. If a reliable resource mentions or implies or calls Dan Wagner the founder, then we should write it as such. If editors have problem it being neutral, it can be modified to attribution like "[source here] called [or credited] Dan Wagner as the founder of British E-Commerce." Your calculations and dates have no value here just like mine. Neither can you combine and research different sources. We will article what a references ''says'' properly. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[36m95.210.221.6: Melcous, If you disagree, I can collect all resources and start an RFC to get a better consensus. I can do that in the next days unless you people are willing to discuss the attributed suggestion I gave. rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mYak shaving: Ok, setting aside the contributions you claim to be WP:OR, the fact remains that the articles you've presented have not stated that the subject is 'the founder of the British e-commerce' (the actual quote). Implication is not adequate for WP:BLP. WP:BLPREMOVE clearly states '''Remove immediately any contentious material about a living person that...is a conjectural interpretation of a source (see No original research)'''. Your supposition is, and to quote WP:OR, a 'synthesis of published material that serves to reach or '''imply''' a conclusion not stated by the sources'. By all means, provide more evidence so I and other editors can reconsider the proposal. Also, you may wish to consider WP:BLPSELF and make a post to WP:BLPN and request that other 'uninvolved editors evaluate the article to make sure it is fairly written and properly sourced.' rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[37mOl king col: About a page up I was asked for my opinion, for what it's worth here it is.  has presented a couple of solid sources that do associate one of  the subjects previous companies with e-commerce in its earliest days (side note / question -  has stated they're in France, so  I am curious which library in France had copies of English newspapers from over 20 years ago, and English Marketing magazines from 30 years ago? Just curious for my future reference). However  and wikipedias own pages E-commerce clearly show that e-commerce was happening before the subjects business began. As such and in accordance with what https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability,_not_truth#.22If_it.27s_written_in_a_book.2C_it_must_be_true.21.22 I  believe that the following is extremely relevant to this claim '''In some cases, publication in a reliable source is not sufficient to establish that a view is significant. Reliable sources may be outdated or disputed by other sources.''' with the two provided sources being 20 and 30 years old they are hardly the most up to date, and therefore it has not been demonstrated that the claim that the subject is "the founder of British ecommerce" is verifiable and / or a valid claim and so I do not support it being re-inserted in the article. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
