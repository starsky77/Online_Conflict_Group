Yet the only place this information appears in this article is in the notes for the sources 2 and 3. Is there a good reason for this? If not, both the lead and several places throughout the article need to be edited to accurately reflect this, and I will do so shortly.', 'username': 'MjolnirPants', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
{'text': "Look at all the examples of the appeal. They were all to what would be called legitimate authorities, but wound up being fallacious because the authorities were wrong. The appeal to authority is right when its right but wrong when its wrong, so its like circular reasoning or an ad hominem: it doesn't actually provide any evidence for the claim. Plenty of sources on the page state this, and discuss why each form of the argument listed is fallacious. Appeals to authority wind up being circular reasoning, like the page says. The issue is that while its not automatically wrong to appeal to authorities, it doesn't actually provide evidence that your claim is correct.", 'username': 'Perfect Orange Sphere', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': "My point is that it's not an informal fallacy unless the authority appealed to is not a legitimate authority. Just because an argument is wrong doesn't make it a fallacy.

{'text': 'Yes, \'\'most\'\' uses of "authority X says Y, so Y must be true" would fall under the examples given. But that\'s not an overwhelming majority. For instance "Over 99% of all biologists agree that evolution is a fact, therefore evolution is almost certainly a fact," is not an informal fallacy. All of science and education is based upon the assumption that experts are correct more often than not, and all of the technology we have, as well as the skill gap between experts and non-experts in every possible set of skills stands as evidence that this assumption is correct. It\'s even logically sound to argue that learning about a subject grants more knowledge about a subject. After all, no-one attends college only to find that they\'re expected to teach themselves all of mathematics, history, literature, composition and the sciences through trial-and-error, with no reference material.', 'username': 'MjolnirPants', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}

Its no different from the old argument that most medical scientists believed the fevers were caused by an environmental factor, therefore it was concluded that was almost certainly a fact.

Where in the article is this even hinted at? Because I find find numerous passages in the article which directly contradict this. The examples chosen even seem to be hand-picked to refute this.

{'text': 'The second source was recently added, and it looks like there was a lot of contention over it. We can remove it to make the page consistent - it doesn\'t look particularly reliable since its just a random website about logical fallacies. Aside from that the page looks consistent to me - it cites sources for the fallacy and gives evidence and examples. The quote the article ends with really hits home why its a fallacy and what leads to it. Also, do you disagree with what I said: "If the authorities believe what they do based off of evidence, then that evidence is where any authority would really be. If they don\'t believe what they do because of evidence, then their beliefs are not evidence based and thus carry no weight"? If you do disagree, why?

{'text': 'Also, contrary to the claim that "All of science and education is based upon the assumption that experts are correct more often than not", we have reliable sources like http://www.nomads.usp.br/pesquisas/design/objetos_interativos/arquivos/restrito/umpleby_science_cybernetics.pdf presented at the conference on Mutual Uses of Cybernetics and Science.

{'text': "As far as appealing to authority to discuss appeals to authority, the irony isn’t lost on me.

But do you have any response to the meat of what I’m saying? That “If the authorities believe what they do based off of evidence, then that evidence is where any authority would really be.

{'text': 'Now as far as the other sources go, it is true that some argue it isn’t a fallacy, but they are a minority among relevant philosophers. According to the book "Contemporary Debates in the Philosophy of Science" by Christopher Hitchcock, on page 161 in my copy, it says "Of prime concern for the issue…are the rules that apply to the researchers themselves. A vocal minority effectively argue their own research transcends empiricism, stating that the public should accept their word by virtue of the fact that it came from one of their standing, and reject it only when others at their level do so. Though the ad verecundiam has such advocates, their expertise resides largely outside of the field of the philosophy of science…Philosophers of science remain in broad unanimity that it is the facts themselves that bring the proof. Those who use their position to express otherwise are…going against their own teachings by…disregarding the consensus of the field on which they speak."', 'username': 'FL or Atlanta', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}
{'text': 'So it seems like people in other professions sometimes say the appeal to authority isn’t a fallacy.

{'text': "That is completely untrue. '''Virtually every single resource on the internet''' agrees that there is no fallacy in trusting the word of an established expert, with many of those resources coming from well established, reliable experts in the field. I limited the sources I provided above to educational institutes, but there are many more reliable sources available online. Even the very first source in this article mentions it. I can literally find dozens of reliable sources to state the caveat that appeals to legitimate expertise are not fallacious. You might be able to find a meager handful of sources which don't mention it, and maybe one or two that explicitly deny it. Even then, I doubt they would be very reliable.\nThat's strange. Because that passage appears nowhere in my copy, nor in the digital copy available online\nI gave you multiple examples of philosophy, education and argumentation experts stating this. You gave me a false quote from a book and a martial artist's opinion.\nNo, because that would violate WP:UNDUE by diminishing an important caveat made by virtually every reliable source on the subject.
