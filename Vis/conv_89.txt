{'text': 'It\'s an offline source. I think Shuki added it as a reference, so hopefully they have access to it, or know where to find it. It doesn\'t really matter if the source is being used for a direct quote or not (per WP:NONENG, "When citing such a source without quoting it, the original and its translation should be provided if requested by other editors: this can be added to a footnote or the talk page."). I don\'t really care what language it is in, so long as a translation I can understand is provided. It\'s being cited for quite a few things - more than any other source currently in the article. The statements in which it is currently the only source being cited are:\n[The name Psagot] expresses the hope that the new village will achieve a peak in settlement and study of the Torah.\nIn 1981, Ariel Sharon, then Israeli Minister of Defense, told Pinchas Wallerstein, head of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, that he would support initiatives to settle the area.\nAfter the first families moved to the site, the Supreme Court of Israel ordered a freeze on further settlement activity in the wake of an Arab property claim that was later rejected. In the spring of 1982, fifteen trailer homes were brought to the site and building plans for 48 houses were approved by the Minister of Housing and Construction David Levy. ←\xa0\xa0', 'username': 'George', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
