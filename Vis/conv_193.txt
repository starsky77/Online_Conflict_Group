{'text': 'This may seem like a small item, but it\'s important and I don\'t want to edit war over it.  I do not see where Focus on the Family uses the term "recreational drugs".

I think "drug abuse" is basically what the organization is against and that is the terminology I propose.', 'username': '72Dino', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
