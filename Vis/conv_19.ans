QUOTE: "''There has been a tendency among historical linguists to think of Malayalam as having diverged directly from Tamil (the Tamil is spoken from the ancient times in what is today Kerala), perhaps as late as the thirteenth century. But this view is almost certainly wrong. Tamil and Malayalam must have separated from one another at a much earlier stage perhaps around the first millennium AD, as we can see from the several archaic features of Malayalam.‚Äù'' UNQUOTE.

You can see it here - https://www.academy.ac.il/Index2/Entry.aspx?nodeId=809&entryId;=18357. There is no reason to think that his comments on Malayalam are on par with the sources that are already given. The origin of both Malayalam and Tamil are traced back to some form of Proto-Dravidian or Proto-Tamil-Malayalam. The authoritative references are already provided. If you wish to add your own comments to this, then please provide similar sources. And Shulman or any others that you provide, unfortunately, do not come anywhere near for this.

[32m80.229.155.49: There has to be an agreement on semantics before anyone can have a serious discussion on the evolution of Malayalam. 'Tamil' can refer to 3 different stages of the language, 'Old Tamil', 'Middle Tamil' and 'Modern Tamil'.
The difference between a 'language' and 'dialect' must also be defined. In the case of Modern Tamil and Malayalam, it is clear from the ancient literature that the people of Tamilakam (ancient Kerala and Tamil Nadu) regarded themselves as speaking the same language called 'Tamil' which was Old Tamil. This was mutually intelligible despite dialectal differences (East coast vs West coast).
''Govindakutty paper only highlights 3 dialectal differences''' such as varying pronunciations of the initial 'n', the addition of 'u' in East coast Tamil as a second person oblique form, and the preservation of the cluster 'lk' in words such as 'Kolkkai' in the West coast dialect. East coast Tamil has changed the 'lk' into 'rk' e.g. 'Korkai'. '''It is laughable to claim that this is evidence of a different language called Malayalam in the ancient period.''' It is evidence of a different dialect for sure and Govindakutty does not claim otherwise. His designation of 'Proto-Tamil-Malayalam' is only correct if you regard the 'Tamil' in that term as 'Modern Tamil'. But we already have a term for that common language given in the classical literature of that period and it is Tamil, now known in the modern era as 'Old Tamil'. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument

[31mHyper9: Though your questions are interesting, it is fairly obvious that you do not understand why and how Malayalam is connected to Sangam literature. And I can tell you that it is definitely not the way you think it is. Like you, I am not interested in either an edit war or taking any classes for you. And as for your exhortations on Tamil or Sanskrit "pride" or "classical" etc etc - they are frankly irrelevant and only serve to stray away from looking at the topic objectively. The Govindankutty article uses just 3 examples for illustrative purposes, there are probably hundreds. It also clearly states that Malayalam cannot be considered as a derivative of any form of Tamil (Old, Middle or Modern) but that it can only be derived from what is designated as 'Proto-Dravidian' or 'Proto-Tamil-Malayalam' - which is also the source of Tamil. What part of that is not clear?? rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mHyper9: Most of your points on Malayalam are erroneous and cannot be characterised so easily as you try to do. I am frankly not against any well sourced and clearly researched information but most editors here are often just raging and ranting and providing their own opinions which, like mine, are of little value. Such claims are often supported by weak sources by general historians and linguists which is usually outdated as far as Malayalam is concerned and so there is little point in referring to them. If you wish to get answers to questions, you can post them (nicely) on my page but I am not inclined to answer your general and unrelated questions here as many of them are not relevant.

[31mHyper9: There is no misquoting, as Shanmugam provides a discussion on the issue and then provides a clear conclusion. Only the conclusion is used. Also, the other point he is making is that the relationship between the languages is complex over time, not a simple tree diagram. But that is not the same as saying that the languages are not existing independently. In fact, by selecting parts of his discussion that suit you, you wilfully ignore his final conclusion of the presence of spoken Malayalam around 5th century AD (ie his dating of Sangam literature). If there is any contribution that needs to be made, you can summarise them and add them to the page but there is no need to copy-paste the entire paper here.

[34mNagadeepa: , (Hyper9) has distorted the work of S.V. Shanmugam (1976). It does '''NOT''' support the fringe view that Malayalam was a separate language from Tamil in the ancient period. In fact, Shanmugam clearly suggests that the idea that Malayalam originated independently from Proto-Dravidian is untenable:
'"'''Kerala''' during the Sangam age '''formed part of a larger linguistic area called Tamilakam, 'the Tamil speaking region''''...Many Tamil poets hailed from this area. Poets like Kapilar, Paranar, Kappiyanar were from the Kerala part of ancient Tamilakam. One of the Sangam works, Pattirupattu was written eulogizing the Chera kings who were the rulers of one part of the Kerala country. Another Sangam work Ainkurunuru, an anthology, was collected and edited in response to an order from one of the Chera kings. The grammatical treatise, Tolkappiyam, which is the earliest extant literary composition in Tamil, is considered to have been have written by a scholar who belonged to the southern-most part of the Kerala coast. '''So, there is no doubt that the language of literature was Centamil, 'standard Tamil', in Kerala at the time'''."
'"'''a slightly different dialect''', preserving some archaic features not found in any of the literary works of Tamil, must have been vogue in Kerala at the time. Ramaswami Ayyar refers to these features as 'archaisms preserved in the West-coast colloquials'."''
'"Nevertheless, many changes, which have taken place in the historical period of Tamil, had occurred in Malayalam also. As already noted, only these changes are responsible for Ramaswami Ayyar to say that Malayalam separated from Tamil in the Early Middle Tamil period. Thus, it seems quite certain that the evolution of Malayalam cannot be explained by a tree diagram, i.e. split process alone."''
'"Yet, some scholars of Malayalam still believe that Malayalam should have originated independently from the Proto-Dravidian at a very early stage. Despite Ramaswami Ayyar's exposition of the '''untenability of this theory''' as early as 1936, a few Malayalam scholars cling to it, their sole support being the presence of some archaisms in the language." rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mNagadeepa: Ramaswami Ayyar - The Evolution of Malayalam Morphology, 1936 Cochin government press - '''a whole book''' by a '''Malayalam linguistic expert''' on the evolution of the language is forthright on the widely held assertion that Malayalam is derived from Middle Tamil:
P138-141  ''As already pointed out above i'''t is with Early Middle Tamil that Malayalam is most intimately related.''' I have been led to stress the question of affiliations so much here because of the view prevailing among some scholars in Malabar (Kerala) that in point of linguistic kinship, Malayalam stands in relation to Tamil on as much a footing of equality as Kannada or even Telugu.''
'"Those who maintain that "Malayalam is as much independent of Tamil as Kannada or Telugu" seek support for their view in the following postulates of theirs. It is necessary to examine them here in some detail in view of the vogue obtaining for them among some Malayalam scholars: but '''I may say at once that some of these postulates (see below for discussion) are wholly untenable''', while others are not proved or supported, and further that even if it happens that some of these postulates could be in the future be supported by data which are now not available, one has to remember that '''these features (appearing as archaisms) are after all so few''' that they cannot touch anything more than the outermost fringe of the problem of affinities; for, as I have already pointed out above, correspondences and derivative relationships between Malayalam and a stage of speech answering to Early Middle Tamil are so numerous and fundamental that '''there would be no scientific warrant for any view other than that Malayalam is most intimately allied to stage of speech corresponding to Early Middle Tamil''', with a few archaisms peculiar to the west coast".''
'On the whole, '''except for a very few archaisms''' like the inflexional n'in-, the plural imperatives with vin, ppin, and perhaps constructions like ceyyam and ceyyarudu, '''the features of Malayalam morphology are directly related to, or immediately derivable from a stage of speech corresponding to what may now be described as Early Middle Tamil'''."''
Ramaswami Ayyar conclusively puts Govindakutty's ludicrous theory (based on the meagre evidence of 3 dialectal differences) to rest. The book is available here:

[34mNagadeepa: (1) Malayalam is derived from an ancient West Coast dialect of Tamil. The evidence for this is overwhelming in both the linguistic and historical record. It should be made clear in the opening paragraph that this is the widespread view accepted by most scientific scholars. The fringe theory that Malayalam has an older root independent from Tamil is not equatable.
(2) During the¬†ancient period¬†Kerala formed part of a larger linguistic area called¬†Tamilakam, 'The Tamil speaking region'. Much of the extensive¬†ancient Tamil literature was composed in Kerala including¬†TolkƒÅppiyam,¬†Ainkurunuru,¬†Pathitrupathu¬†and¬†Silappatikaram. There is no doubt that the language of literature in Kerala was¬†Standard Old Tami·∏ª (centami·∏ª) at the time and this should be mentioned on the page. Internal historical evidence from the said literature clearly shows a Tamil consciousness among the people of Kerala, who saw themselves as speaking Tamil in a Tamil region.
(3) A slightly different spoken colloquial dialect, preserving some archaic features not found in any of the literary works of Tamil must have also been present in Kerala at the time. This accounts for the differences which has led some fringe scholars (e.g. Govindakutty) to claim an independent origin. However, this fringe view has been jettisoned by more serious and scientific scholars such as S.V Shanmugam and Ramaswami Ayyar.
(4) All of the above points I have made are supported by the following reference which has been distorted by you:
S.V. Shanmugam (1976) - Formation and Development of Malayalam, Indian Literature,Vol. 19, No. 3 (May-June 1976)
You have used this above reference to claim an independent origin of Malayalam when in actual fact it supports the mainstream view that Malayalam is largely derived from an ancient form of Tamil.

He provides the clearest proof for his conclusion on Page 26 - which you do not appear to have seen.
