[31mZScarpia: Possible causes rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mZScarpia: Not, so far as I can see, currently given in the article as a possible cause for the collision is that the captain left it too late to execute the turn which headed the ship along the coast of Giglio. This Telegraph article quotes the captain as having said: "I was navigating by sight because I knew the depths   well and I had done this manoeuvre three or four times. But this time I   ordered the turn too late and I ended up in water that was too shallow." Higher up, the (newspaper) article states that the reef was well marked. There is an ambiguity there which would perhaps be worth looking into, well marked meaning that the reef could have been marked by buoys as well as being shown clearly on charts. If the reef was marked by buoys, it would compound the culpability for the collision.   ¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Üê¬†¬†¬†¬†  (Clarified that it is the Telegraph article that says the reef is well marked: ) rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mSteveO1951: This new Possible Causes section has far too many speculations (long since abandoned) that do not apply in this incident. Please trim it or rip it. The matter is covered in Shipwreck and any edits should go there, not in a separate section riddled with old theories. Also, I am not aware that any part of the Article says that the reef is "well marked"; it states that it is charted, which is different. Marked means that there is an "aid to navigation" visible to the eye on or near a hazard. The charts show no aids to navigation and none has been alleged by any published source. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation

[34m195.137.93.171: Google Images [nautical chart symbols] suggests 'obstruction, depth unknown' !
That's a '''very indistinct marking for a rather important feature''' ! I could almost forgive the captain for overlooking it and claiming a 'rock not marked on the chart' ! It's probably not there now anyway. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34m195.137.93.171: While I'm here, people claim the final southward leg may have been drifting with the current. Watch the Webcam Timelapse Video. Note the tendency for vessels with no wake to drift north all day - the Mediterranean is not significantly tidal.  ‚Äî Preceding unsigned comment added by rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[31mZScarpia: The point I was making is that the captain himself was quoted as saying that he left the turn too late and ended up in shallow water, which seems like an important point which I can't see currently mentioned in the article. So, it was an error which the captain himself supposedly admitted, not speculation.   ¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Üê¬†¬†¬†¬† rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mSteveO1951: Anyone wanting to learn how to read a nautical chart should start with NOAA Chart 1, which is not a chart at all but rather defines all the features of a chart and what they mean. http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/mcd/chartno1.htm  That said, I can help by telling you that the little dotted circle is an indication that the water at that spot is shallower than surrounding water but is not a rock. And finally, none of this matters: if you read the Article, and the footnotes about the impact point, you can find that police divers photographed the point of impact, a subsurface rock, within Le Scole reef, known as Scole Piccola. It has nothing to do with the circle of shallower water. I hope this helps. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mSteveO1951: The Article states the best possible evidence for where "the captain ended up" and that is that the divers photographed huge strips of ship's hull at Scole Piccola (see my post above explaining about nautical charts). Yes, the captain says "I turned too late" but he never used the words "into shallow water" or the Italian equivalent. Some editors argue that we ought not put in what the captain "said" or what the company "said" but rather only put in what happened according to consensus publications. As is, the Article does presently give some names to statements, because that is part of the story. Later, a year from now, I believe the article will not have all this detail about who said what but rather will state that the captain was sailing without the computer navigation system and failed to turn in time and struck the reef. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mSteveO1951: I have disputed this section of the Article because, at least, it twice uses the words "not yet" in respect of surmized causes not having been ruled out. Although those old sources might have used those words (as of the publication date), it is highly misleading to have them in the Article text after the facts are much more clear. The captain has admitted that he was sailing solely by sight and turned too late. End of story. There was no other cause for the initial impact and no current publication or source is saying that any other cause exists. Also this section asserts misleadingly that the ship "went slightly closer to Giglio" on 14 August; well, in a certain sense that cannot be true (!) and the ship did not on that day go closer to Le Scole but rather went close to a cliff (Punta Gabbianara) having no extending reef, and it was in daylight and the ship was then using its computer controlled steering. This is bad, outdated, misleading text.   And BTW, the fact that she sailed close on 14 august is entirely irrelevant to the cause of this incident. It may be true but it is misleading as stated by this old story. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mSteveO1951: I found the longer quotation and put it in. "Someday" all this detail will not be necessary but so long as this section has outdated, misleading, "not well written" (I am trying to be polite) statements on Possible Causes, then I will continue to have to counterbalance that by the great mass of current, undisputed published evidence that there is only one cause - the Captain erred in steering the route he intended. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34m195.137.93.171: Thanks - it's 35 years since I was a Sea Scout ! Looks like it would have been blue inside if it were a 'danger line'. They may not have been expecting the Concordia when risk assessing it, though ! I did see an impressive photo of a serpentine steel strip yesterday, but I didn't see its location. I'm sure the rock embedded in the hull must have left some useful traces, too. rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
