{'text': 'The main issue, in my opinion, is the use of WP by some trans activists to encourage the use of the terms they themselves prefer over the terms used by other members of the trans communities or by medical/scientific experts.  There are activists who prefer terms that indicate their womanhood (such as \'\'transwoman\'\') over terms that do not, and the term "she-male" contains includes the word "male" rather than "female."  The term is used non-pejoratively, however, by sex trade workers and in sex research studies.\nRather than merely indicate the alternative uses, however, the article space is becoming another WP battleground on which community activists selectively cite the uses that they prefer and attempt to discredit those who do otherwise.  (That is, instead of the article saying \'\'Some people use the term this way while other people use it that way\'\' the article is being pushed to say \'\'This term means only this one thing and all dissenters are transphobic.\'\') This pattern has played through a great many of the trans-related articles.  Rather than precipitate a repeat conflict, however, I instead encourage you to read the article and sources and come to your own opinion.', 'username': 'James Cantor', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Providing clarification']}
{'text': 'I may be missing something here but both cases are true. It is commonly used in a derogatory fashion and, similar to other slurs, has been in part either adopted or reclaimed. It is still a despised term and any scientist who had the nerve to set up a classification would seem rather disreputable whereas just noting it as a self-descriptor by those the scientist is studying would seem acceptable similar to having a list of different labels or even a blank where someone would self-identify. Blanchard\'s bit, IMHO, should include that his work is maligned for such usage. Meanwhile, erotic and sex industries capitalize on the use and transwomen do identify as shemale as needed to earn money, they would also just as easily identify as almost anything else conceivable and believable to appease a customer\'s preference. So I think it\'s a little disingenuous to assert the point with more emphasis than that. IMHO, it\'s a temporary label - even when used as a self-descriptor - not conforming to one\'s self-identity as much as reclaiming a word like "freak" "nigger" and "faggot" to take the sting out and dis-empower ones degraders. Usage within one\'s circle can be seen from a sociological view but I\'m quite suspicious of adopting it well beyond that or that the number of people doing so is significant.', 'username': 'Benjiboi', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Providing clarification', 'Coordinating edits']}
{'text': 'I can suggest only that one look up the references given in the article, which do not say what the main page says they say.  For example, the main page says that the term shemale "is often seen by transsexual people as a term of abuse" citing as a source Herbst (2001).  Herbst (2001) does not say any such thing, however.  In fact, the only comment that Herbst makes regarding the connotation of the term is "The term may also refer positively to androgyny."  The second source given on the main page is an online dictionary, which has questionable status as an RS, and which says, in parentheses, "sometimes offensive," which I agree with, but which is not very neutrally conveyed by \'often a term of abuse.\'\nIn general, the term \'shemale\' is considered derogatory when applied to people \'\'other than\'\' MtF folks who have socially transitioned but not undergone gential surgery (e.g., masculine lesbians or MtF folk who \'\'have\'\' completed transition).  The cites in opposition to the term are comments made by community activists who are generally postsurgical MtF folk (and, thus, for whom the term would be innaccurate and negative), who have expertise only in areas outside linguistics (such as biology), and who are expressing their personal (and non-expert) opinions about the use of the term \'\'for them\'\' rather than the use of the term \'\'in general\'\'.\nTo repeat my earlier comment, I agree entirely with the page reflecting the mixed status of the term, but not with using the article space to actively promote the idea that the term is or is not offensive.  As a tangent, I am not actually the person who added the POV-tag to the page.  Whether the current content of the page accurately conveys what is said in the cites, or adds a spin of its own, is up to you to decide for yourself after reading the RS\'s.', 'username': 'James Cantor', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Providing clarification', 'Coordinating edits']}
