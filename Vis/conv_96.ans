[31mCroq: Yugoslav Nationalsm rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mDirector: This is about linguistics not politics. In the Balkans linguistics (and science in general) are consistently influenced by politics, communist or nationalist to equal extent. Local publications are therefore to be disregarded without exception, both from the pre-1990 or post-1990 periods. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mDirector: Croq, your ideological references and borderline personal attacks serve only to apparently satisfy you, other than that I cannot imagine any effect. Don't let me stop you though... rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mChipmunkdavis: Croq has now done exactly the same edit twice, even though it was reverted the first time. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mCroq: Croq changed in every edit some details. But you are reverting everytime without discussion. Same as it happened in Ex Yugoslavia when the communists tryed to establish their "Yugoslav Language". Really interesting POV pushing team here.. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mDirector: I'm sure we'd all be glad to play the bad guys in your glorious crusade here, but I'm afraid Wikipedia is not the venue. You have been reverted, your edits are opposed, and you are engaged in a WP:EDIT WAR. In accordance with Wiki guidelines I am formally warning you to cease attempting to push your opposed edit via edit-warring, and achieve consensus on the talkpage via discussion prior to restoring any of it again. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[34mChipmunkdavis: Apparently we are a bunch of POV pushing vandals. Croq is threatening to report me to admins for POV pushing on my , probably in response to me warning him. Besides, I didn't see any major changes in any of the edits Croq made. They all pretty much said the same things, such as "hybrid language" and "communist yugoslavia" that were blatant POV pushing. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mCroq: There are so many reasons why this article is pure POV: You removed that this language is controversial (and everybody knows very well that this is a fact), the sentence with the Novi Sad Agreement of and so many other things. This pseudo-language is a part of history of Yugoslavia when the dictators tried to establish a "Yugoslav Language". It ended in the same way as their general Ratko Mladic, Slobodan Milosevic and so many others ended. Please accept that the history is not written by the guys like them and that democracy and freedom has won against tyranism. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[36mJorisvS: Removing mentioning its controversial status within former Yugoslavia, especially Croatia, is, of course, POV. However, trying to deny its factual existence is equally POV: speakers of both (standard) Croatian and Serbian can easily understand eachother, making SC a language from a linguistic-scientific perspective; such things do not cease to be (or come to be) when the political situation changes. As an encyclopedia we have an obligation to report this (and the other) facts, no matter the sensitivities. (We thus must also report dictators' abuses concerning the language.) Also note that SCâ‰ Yugoslav language here. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mDirector: The language is not "controversial" in ex-Yugoslavia - its existence is simply not an issue. Each state promotes its own centralized standard language, and adherence to the ever-changing standard is not an issue of debate. Serbo-Croatian is considered not to be in existence in any form and is simply not a subject of controversy at all.
In other words, in ex-Yugoslavia a language's existence is generally considered to be defined by its standardization. Since no political organization or institution standardizes Serbo-Croatian, it is considered "not to exist" simply because of that, and since the myriad nationalist political institutions of each state institute each their own language, these are considered to be in existence (no matter how absurd their separation may be, e.g. Bosnian language, Montenegrin language, etc.) The above is evident from the responses of the opposing parties. Wikipedia, just like the scientific community, is not to be influenced by political institutions. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mCroq: No, Director. We know very well the phasis of political tryal to create a "Yugoslav Language" thert SC should become. But it ended in the same way as the whole country. And stop calling poeple that do not share your unitartistic opinion as "nationalists". By the way ist is the same way like comunists called those who oppose their dictatoirship and fought for freedom in their countries as dissidents. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH4: Stating your stance
[31mCroq: That is not truth, it contoversal there, too. The people know very well there which language they speak. In the croatian or serbian wikipedia such a discussion is not necessary.Â´ rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mCroq: Yes, JorisvS, we agree that the the status is controversal. By the way not only in "Ex-YU" but also other lingists. So lets put it in the article in the beginning. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mDirector: Crusade, crusade, communists, freedom, unitarianists, etc... I see no sense in responding to such rot. Croq, you are not getting the message, please read the following very carefully and please do not ignore it in future posts: this issue has ''nothing'' to do with politics and history. Nothing. You seem not to know what matters on Wikipedia. If you want to be taken seriously you should cease writing these utterly pointless essays and start referring to the international scientific community... or you could just keep posting these insulting pretentious proclamations, I don't know... this is not the backwater dump that is hrWiki. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion, DH0: Name calling/hostility
[32mDirector: Oh laugh-out-loud what nonsense... you're actually opposing me while agreeing with me. D Very telling, I think, about the usefullness of any discussion along these lines. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[35m83.131.49.180: On a side note, Croq's only valid point of the language being politically controversial is thoroughly covered in the HUUUGE Present situation section. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mCroq: SC is not only political controversal. ThatsÂ´s only one point. The second one is also that it i POV pushing that Croatian, Serbian, Bosniak, Montenegrin are the same languages. They are similar but not the same. I guess for not native speakers maybe difficult to understand (same as if a native english speaker would start teaching me about something) but not accespting that Croats, Serbs, Montenegrins and Bosniaks do not know it is very arrogant. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[33mIvan Å tambuk: No, they're not the same. They just happen to be 99% the same by the fact that they are all standardized on the same subdialect of the same dialect. Modern standard Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian have the same phonology, the same complex accentual system, same complex inflection, almost the same syntax... The only relevant differences are in some 5% of lexis of which majority are systematic and intuitively predictable (in Croatia they prefer ''-telj'' where sometimes in Serbia they prefer ''-lac'', and similar). You need to stop downplaying obvious commonalities/similarities among the standards and dispense with abusive political name-calling. Your personal nationalist identity is of no concern us. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation, DH3: Policing the discussion
[37m213.103.160.194: No Mr Stambuk, you personal non qualification is so obvious for native speakers that you can sell you wisedom only to wikipedians who are not native speakers. Forget it, donÂ´t play here with percentages, they donÂ´t keep water. You are wasting time with your personal wiki  project. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mChipmunkdavis: Per wikipedia policy, unqualified average serbs/croats/bosniks/montenegrins (sorry if denonyms are slightly off) would probably hold less water on this article than others, due to an inherent POV. That is not to say that their opinions are not important. And percentages do keep water, they are base facts. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mDirector: Just to be perfectly clear: the languages are ''completely'' mutually intelligible. The Slovene language is a separate South Slavic language ''very'' similar to Serbo-Croatian, and a Serbo-Croatian speaker may understand some Slovene words, perhaps even the general meaning of what the Slovene-speaker is trying to say. On the other hand, a Serb and a Croat may often not even realize they (supposedly) speak "different languages". In other words, its much easier to list the very few differences than the completely common grammar between Croatian and Serbian. Anyone demanding "translation" from Croatian to Serbian or ''vice versa'' would not be understood as being serious and would literally be ''laughed at'' (as was actually the case during a trial in Bosnia and Herzegovina). rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mDirector: The absurdities go on and on... Croatian supposedly has two secondary dialects, Chakavian and Kajkavian, the differences between standard Croatian and its two dialects are vastly and incomparably greater than those between standard Croatian and standard Serbian (as both are based on Shtokavian), to the point its not even debatable. I'm not kidding - pure Kajkavian and Chakavian are virtually ''unintelligible'' to a standard Croatian speaker, with very different syntax and a ''LOT'' more different words than you'll find comparing Serbian or Croatian. The absurdity is this: Croq will undoubtedly tell you that Chakavian and Kajkavian are the same language as Croatian, but will exclaim that Serbian is "much too different" to be the same language. And not just him, most people from Croatia will tell you the same P rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31m89.172.55.34: I would just like to add - Kajkavian (especially the versions spoken around the Gorski kotar area, probably those in Medjimurje too) is actually more similar to Slovene and probably easier to understand for a native Slovene speaker than for a native (stokavian) speaker of Croatian. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mDirector: Exactly, which further blurs the language differences: if Kajkavian is a Serbo-Croatian dialect, then Slovene can also be considered as part of the single "Serbo-Croato-Slovene language", which was official 1918-1943/45. This of course is an out of date concept today, and generally more debatable. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
