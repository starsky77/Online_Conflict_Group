[32mJorge alo: The last academic to write on Beatriz was the spanish Olivera Serrano, on this XXI century, He named is book Â«Beatriz de Portugal: la pugna dinÃ¡stica Avis - TrastÃ¡mara. He speaks of Miguel as an equivocation of genealogists of the XVII and XVIII centuries. He refer three times the question, pages 43, 354 and 397.
His words on page 42 are: Â«Beatrice had no childs, in spite of the equivoqued affirmations of some genealogists of the XVII and XVIII centuries, that attribute her one called MiguelÂ».
Here it is in spanish: Â«Beatriz no tuvo hijos, pese a las equivocadas afirmaciones de algunos genealogistas de los siglos XVII e XVIII, que le atribuyen uno llamado MiguelÂ».
Serrano made research and haven't found nothing, unless the Â«equivocations of genealogists of the XVII and XVIII centuriesÂ». He thinks they have made confusion with Miguel da Paz, son of King Manuel I de Portugal. And it's true there's nothing till de XVI century on the historians of Portugal and Castile, because I have made my own research.
So, I think that the German contemporary source of Borgatya followed the error of some of the genealogists referred by Serrano. And that source wasn't the only one. For example, a portuguese historian referred on the portuguese article of Beatrice did the same error. Well, Borgatya wants to make an article thats affirm as true an error. And is for this I'm opposed.
Another question, in the article Beatrice of Portugal, is Â«the claimÂ» in 1383. It is Juan I himself, on his testament, that says there were two claims: his own and the  claim of Beatriz. You want to delete Juan I himself? And both the Chronicles of Ayala and FernÃ£o Lopes explain very well that Juan I had is own claim.
So, if Borgatya persists, in spite of this explanation, on the "undo" in Beatrice, and in reediting an article about someone that never existed, I have to put the problem to the administrators.

[31mBorgatya: If I read Jorge's words well it still remains: one statement one denial, so you (judges), admins are prudent, you cannot rely a delation on one denial. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mJorge alo: No it is not one denial: The denials are from all the chronists till de XVI century. And more, Ayala wrote Â«there were no childsÂ». So, when you say I only give one state you are reading me wrong, at least. And one thing is an kind of general genealogical almanac and other thing is a research of a spanish academic in is own land. More, everybody knows that, evem in our days, genealogical works are plenty of errors. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mBorgatya: The Portuguese want to eliminate Beatriz reign, and they do not want to consider her as queen regnant of Portugal. So to this viewpoint it is not surprise that Beatriz's son is considered as phantom. Jorge's sorces do not eliminate my sources because EuropÃ¤ischen Stammtafeln are serious genealogy work. And the German precision is famous. So Jorge's sources can be handled with some debts and criticism. Suppose, Jorge is right (provided but not allowed), I ask: why was Jorge afraid about the discussion if the truth is on his side. If I know, I am right, I am not afraid to discuss and defend my truth. The main evidence that he is not right that he is afraid of discussion and wanted to delete it without discussing it. And Phantomsteve should have got this article discussed on the pages above earlier instead of infamous deletion. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Stating your stance
[32mJorge alo: Give us the sources that the Â«German precisionÂ» used. Are they genealogists of the XVII or XVIII century? You are negating all the historians til the XVII century, amid them Ayala,FernÃ£o Lopes, Froissart, etc., etc. For you the History is what? And Â«the portuguese want to eliminate Beatriz reignÂ»!? What is this? If the Portuguese, in that time, could not considerer her their queen because of the pretensions of her husband, it's you that is going to oblige the actual Portuguese to recognize her as one of their past queen? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mBorgatya: And If Beatriz's son was confused then how his birth date was created. It is weird and incredible that the fakers chose the year 1384 when Beatriz was only twelve (sic)!!!! She and John were married until 1390, so Beatriz got a widow when she was 18 so it would be more logic that Beatriz might give birth to her phantom son in an later time, if his existence is fictional. It is not impossible that a woman may bear a child at the age of twelve but the fakers can have chosen a more credible year. And why did the little prince die in 1385 at the age of 1 because Miguel da Paz, Prince of Portugal was two years old when he died. If there is only confusion, the essential elements of data should be equal: birth: 1398 instead of 1498 and 1400 instead of 1500. If one sees these dates, one observes that these dates are similar to Peter of Aragon (heir of Sicily), so Jorge says: Prince Peter was also phantom?:))) because this follows of his arguments!! If anyone says, it is nonsense, he is right. But it is not nonsense because some users similar to Jorge wanted to delete the article Peter of Aragon but it was unsuccessful action, too and I managed to defend against the attackers.:)) rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mJorge alo: This: Â«The main evidence that he is not right that he is afraid of discussion and wanted to delete it without discussing itÂ», it's a Falacy, and all your paragraph above are falacies. I never said here that she couldn't have a son with eleven years (and not twelve), but the problem is where it is written that was borned a child named Miguel in 1384, dead in 1385, in a Cronicle? in a church document? in the archives of Castile? Where? Yes, I already know it is written with Â«German precisionÂ», but also is written by AntÃ³nio Caetano de Sousa and other genealogists since the XVII century, like you wrote the same affirmation here, in Wikipedia. The problem is there are any sources to that affirmation. If you discover one, my congratulations. Salut, rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Repeated argument
[31mBorgatya: I think, you misunderstood and misinterpreted my words. Your sources at least claim that they do not know about her son but my sources above exactly claims that she gave birth to a son. Even If his existence is disputed, the deletion is wrong solution, I do not understand your
ruthlessness. But it's not me who you must convince about your truth. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mJorge alo: The medieval sources dontÂ´t Â«at least claim that they do not know about her sonÂ», the sources speak that she had no sons or don't refer any sons of that marriage. The contemporary source Olivera Serrano, on a book all about Beatrice's question, so, a specialized work, says she had no sons and that this affirmation: Â«she had a son named MiguelÂ» was a equivocation of genealogists of the XVII and XVIII centuries. He has access to the archives of Castile and Aragon and couldn'f find nothing. But you are a believer on Â«German precisionÂ» and on the Â«Queen Regnant BeatriceÂ». what can we do more? You are a believer that want to give us his truth and we are rude...The problem here is not a matter of truth, yours or mine, it's a problem of sources. Salut, rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mDrKay: The article should at least balance both points of view. Please insert the Serrano material and adjust the text in the article to present the two views as alternatives. Currently, it only presents one side, which is clearly bias. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mJorge alo: I have no point of view about the subject, if there was a child and was named Miguel, very well, that will be a subject, but I defend (this, yes, is a point of view) Wikipedia sources politic must put clear one thing: a called second or third source ''only'' is a real second or third source if she has one or more primary sources studied. If she has not, she isnÂ´t a source at all, itÂ´s mere affirmations. AntÃ³nio Caetano de Sousa, a portuguese genealogist of the XVIII century, wrote that affirmation (HGCRP, I, page 440), and gives, near, as source, Duarte Nunes de LeÃ£o. We can read not only the pages appointed by AntÃ³nio Caetano but all the historical works of Duarte Nunes de LeÃ£o and we dontÂ´t find nothing. We don't find any reference to such Infante in any chronist even till, at least, Juan de Mariana, and he died in 1624. There is no primary document atesting the birth of such individual, all we have is mere affirmations, as Serrano said, of genealogists of the XVII an XVIII. Probably, the german publication referred by Borgatya collected that notice in some of these "sources" (that aren't sources), and so the German publication isn't, too, a source. But we have, by hasard, a primary source that says there were no childrens of Juan I after is first marriage: it's Ayala, on Â«Henry the thirdÂ», page 500, Madrid edition, 1780. A spanish academics, in this XXI century, make a specialized work about Beatrice, defending his own opinions, and atest that there are no primary documents about Miguel. If there are no primary documents, and what we have is only mere affirmations of writers three centuries forward, how can we write anything about such " biographical subject"?
My response is: in the particular case here on discussion, the Miguel hipotetic existence, we do not have nothing atesting it, and we canÂ´t write an article giving life to a XVII and XVIII genealogist's phantom; as subject, we only have here an epistemological question to present, and not a biography to do, and so this biographycal article can't exist, as is written in the Wikipedia instructions, Â«"If a topic has no reliable sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it"Â», but we can put the epistemological question on Beatrice or Juan I pages, as we did in wikipedia on portuguese. And in the general question, can we consider as source someone that only make mere affirmations about the historic past without any primary source or element, my answer is, of course, no. Even when someone presents a thesis on history, he gives the elements where his thesis is founded, and I repeat, in this particular case there is nothing, ''there are no primary sources'' and, for this reason, '' also there are no second or third sources''. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mJorge alo: As this is a epistemological problem, I ask to invite to this discussion all the historians working on english Wikipedia, and not only those (if they exist) specialized on medieval portuguese history. I think it wil be interessant and useful for Wikipedia. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mDrKay: Look, it's obvious that Miguel was imaginary as his mother was only 10 years old at his supposed birth. The question is over how to reconcile the obvious falsehood against the sources that claim he did exist. The page isn't going to be deleted. The best we can hope for is to add the fact that Miguel was a later fiction. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
