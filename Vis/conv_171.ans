[31mShreerajtheauthor: Kenny Dalglish rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mShreerajtheauthor: As far as I know in the club/international/individual awards not every single award has to be sourced. If you look at every football player or manager many are not sourced. But if you follow the internal wiki link for say English Football Hall of Fame or, PFA Players' Player of the Year you will find Kenny Dalglish at the years provided.
Of course If I can find additional external source links then I'll include them as it increases the credibility with more references, but you don't have to remove the current internal link I put there as they are valid, you can check them all.
Look at Alex Ferguson, Bill Shankly, even good rated articles like Lionel Messi. Many of the individual awards are not externally sourced.
Like I said I can add external source references where I find them but it's not defamatory or controversial like you said, and doesn't warrant removal.  â€”Â Preceding unsigned comment added by   â€¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument

[31mShreerajtheauthor: Not trying to be difficult Qed, but then you should remove every single award that every single football player or manager has as 90% of them are unsourced. Check them out. Like I said I would like to restore all of the individual achievements, and as I get time i'll add references that I find. But if you're expecting an external source for Dalglish winning the FWA Footballer of the Year in 1979 then it's VERY hard to find that. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mQed237: WP:OSE I can not be expected to edit all article, but I do know that many honours has been tagged and removed on other articles. When you add something you are responsible to source it. Â  rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
