[31mResearch Method: Nature of the Work rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mResearch Method: Currently the work is described as "'''''An Oak Tree''''' is an iconicIrish Museum of Modern Art Website modernart.ie conceptual artwork created by Michael Craig-Martin RA in 1973.  The work consists of a glass of water on a glass shelf with an accompanying text,Bery, Bryony. "An Oak Tree 1973: Technique and condition text", Tate, June 2005. Retrieved 8 November 2008.Manchester, Elizabeth. "An Oak Tree 1973: Short text, Tate, December 2002. Retrieved 8 November 2008. which states that the work is a fully grown oak tree which looks like a glass of water. Artist's Text Craig-Martin sees the work as a deconstruction of art to reveal its basic component of belief."
This is a misleading description of a dematerialized conceptual artwork. The idea is more important than the shelf etc.
MCM ="I considered that in An Oak Tree I had deconstructed the work of art in such a way as to reveal its single basic and essential element, belief that is the confident faith of the artist in his capacity to speak and the willing faith of the viewer in accepting what he has to say. In other words belief underlies our whole experience of art: it accounts for why some people are artists and others are not, why some people dismiss works of art others highly praise, and why something we know to be great does not always move us. " He doesn't mention shelves at all. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mTyrenius: The introduction is closely referenced to sources. Read them: "In an artist interview in May 2003 Craig-Martin noted that the piece consists of two units; the object and the text." There are numerous references that begin discussing the work by stating, as the Tate does, that "An Oak Tree consists of an ordinary glass of water placed on a small glass shelf". We follow the lead of such sources in our approach. Anything else violates WP:NPOV and becomes WP:OR. This is wikipedia policy and is non-negotiable. Please follow it.

[31mResearch Method: NPOV means including all view points. Your sources do not support what you are saying, within the context that you state it. If you read them, you will see that the "art" is in the Oak Tree or glass of water debate, not in the shelf. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mTyrenius: NPOV means giving due weight to sources, i.e. the majority sources get the majority weight. The majority of sources discuss the work in the way which the article now discusses it, i.e. by describing what it physically consists of, before then examining the conceptual aspects and Craig-Martin's claim for the work. Your argument is an interpretation of the sources and not a following of them. If you have a problem with this, then state clearly and succinctly the text you object to and what you think it should say, and we will get outside input on this.

[31mResearch Method: Examine the section "WORK' it contains lots of stuff that doesn't describe the nature of work itself.
It starts "An Oak Tree is a celebrated[5] artwork created by Michael Craig-Martin RA in 1973. It is now recognized as a turning point in the development of conceptual art, although initially it was met with surprise, if not scorn[6]. It has been described as "questioning the nature of reality."[5]
Interviewed in May 2003, Craig-Martin said the work consists of two parts, text and object.[2] The text is in red print on white; the object is a Duralex glass, which contains water to a level stipulated by the artist and which is located on a glass shelf, whose ideal height is 253 centimetres with matt grey-painted brackets screwed to the wall.[2] The text is behind glass and is fixed to the wall with four bolts.[2] Craig-Martin has stressed that the components should maintain a pristine appearance and in the event of deterioration, the brackets should be resprayed and the glass and shelf even replaced.[2]"" I think it should start by saying that it is a fully grown oak tree, or at least that it should say that sooner than it does. Most sources talk of a glass of water. Critic's reception should be put in that section. The article is a mess. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mTyrenius: I've moved the element of critical evaluation into the Critical reaction section per your observation. The work section describes the content of the work, its nature, and its place within MCM's oeuvre and development. If this section becomes over-long, then it would be appropriate to split it into two sections, one about its construction and conceptual content, the other about its place relating to his other work. Articles should not, however, be divided into choppy sections each with a heading. The idea is for longer continuous sections of prose. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mTyrenius: I think it should start by saying that it is a fully grown oak tree is nonsense. That is an assertion made by the artist as to what it is. The secondary sources do not say it is a fully grown oak tree; they say it is an artwork that consists of a glass of water on a shelf, which MCM asserts is an oak tree. We follow sources. You are pushing your own interpretation. You might like to read WP:TEND. We do not at any point say that it is a fully grown oak tree, unless you find sources that tell us that it is a fully grown oak tree. We can say the text asserts it is a fully grown oak tree, or that MCM says it is a fully grown oak tree, but that is as far as it goes. This fact is in the second sentence as is appropriate.
The article is well constructed and follows wikipedia guidelines.

[32mTyrenius: I've just explained that the article should not consist of short sections each with a heading. You promptly did just that. Could you explain why you have done so? '''''''''' rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mResearch Method: Because the text did not fit the heading. As I understand it, it is appropriate to create headings while the article is still a stub, that will later be filled with text. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mTyrenius: That's not standard practice. Let the article evolve. When there is more text, then break it down, step by step and add headings. The heading is quite OK: "Artwork", which covers the content in general terms. I don't think the reader is going to have a problem with that. It's not a stub any more. '''''''''' rebuttal_labels::
