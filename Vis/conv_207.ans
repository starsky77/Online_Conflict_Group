[31mNicknack009: I've added a "disputed section" tag to the Pre-history section, because it, factually, nonsense. The Ulster Cycle is a body of legends with no value as history, and its chronological setting is probably the least historical thing about it, as discussed in the medieval literature section below. Nobody thinks the TÃ¡in BÃ³ CÃºailnge actually happened, and nobody thinks it happened in the 1st century. Our only historical information as to the political breakdown of pre-historic Ireland is Ptolemy in the 2nd century, who names a population group that can be possibly identified as the ancestor of the Ulaid, but bears no resemblance to the legendary Pentarchy.  Equally, the political breakdown at the dawn of history in the 5th century, as reconstructed from the annals, bears no relation to the Pentarchy.
I'm going to have a go at rewriting this section from scratch, but it'll take me some time to gather my sources. In the meantime, this should stand to explain why the disputed tag is there. rebuttal_labels::

[31mNicknack009: On second thoughts, I've taken the stuff about the Pentarchy and moved it to the medieval literature section, and removed the rest of the Pre-history section, as all that's left is the claim that the Ulster Cycle gives information on the pre-history of the Ulaid, which it doesn't. If I can work up something accurate and sourced about the pre-history of the Ulaid I'll add it later. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMabuska: Firstly it is a work in progress and the stuff at the start was simply a temporary filler. I didn't feel comfortable with it and it was to be re-written and expanded upon. Though the Ulster Cycle does give information on Ulaid (obviously only in terms of mythology) in regards to the alleged political make-up of Ireland, that is its division into five kingdoms and the lack of mention of any form of central monarchy. The 1st century part is only a claim and is sourced so obviously there are people who believed that may have been the time it occurred. Nowhere did it state that it was fact. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMabuska: Seeing as this article isn't about the provinces of Ireland there is no need to delve into the pseudo-history/mythology of the Pentarchy, however obviously it doesn't bear any resemblance to the political breakdown of Ireland in the 5th century because it was long gone by that stage. The process of it disappearing is also in Irish mythology in the forms of TÃºathal Techtmar and Niall of the Nine Hostages, which according to legend came before the 5th century and altered the political face of Ireland. Did you never wonder why some believe that Ireland was anciently divided into five provinces despite the fact at the dawn of recorded history, Ireland was split into at least seven? And on seven, I'll not even go into Keating's notions of what he called the "Septarchy".
You should read Eoin MacNeill's "The Five Fifths of Ireland", where he goes on a good bit about the legendary Pentarchy and its references in the Annals and mythology. Hogan and Hurbert also make mention of it and its constituents. Obviously their sources are pseudo-historians writting centuries after the events so we clearly can't accept any of it as set in stone fact. Yet that doesn't mean we can't include it, as long as we word it so that its clear it is not fact. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMabuska: Just to note, the Pentarchy stuff does fit in better in the literature section. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mNicknack009: I don't think we're very far apart. My objections are to saying that the Ulster Cycle gives us any information on the pre-history of the Ulaid (it can only give is information on what people in the middle ages ''thought'' was the pre-history of the Ulaid, and we can see what people thought changing over time), and to the following sentence:
The principle story of the Ulster Cycle the TÃ¡in BÃ³ CÃºailnge was set during the reign of Conchobar mac Nessa, king of Ulaid, and is believed to have happened in the 1st century.[14]
Particularly the end of it. It would be defensible to say it ''was'' believed to have happened in the 1st century, but not that it ''is'' believed to have happened, which suggests (a) that this particular story is believed to have happened, and (b) the 1st century chronology for its setting, the Pentarchy etc, is accurate. I believe there was, at some point, either a pentarchy or the ideal of a pentarchy - hence the name ''cuige'', fifth, for the Irish provinces even though there's only four of them. But Ptolemy, writing in the 2nd century, shows it can't have gone back as far as the 1st. It probably existed not long before the time of St Patrick and Niall Noigiallach, fourth or at a stretch third century at the very earliest, and from what I've read I'd be surprised if MacNeill would say different. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMabuska: You believe, MacNeill is adamant there was, in his "The Five Fifths of Ireland" he states:
In fact, its origin was prehistoric, and the Pentarchy is the oldest certain fact in the political history of Ireland.					False
2	2015-09-07 16:02:48	Mabuska	I'd assume in regards to Ptolemy, that they were simply recording the names of peoples and kingdoms as given to them, and no distinction was made between whether they were a sub-kingdom or over-kingdom. We will never know.  					False

1	2015-09-07 17:33:59	Nicknack009	Prehistoric", in Irish terms, means "earlier than the fifth century". It needn't be anywhere near as old as Ptolemy to be prehistoric. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mMabuska: I know lol, but MacNeill is still adamant ;-) Just a pity Ptolemy's work was an adaptation of someone elses, and the only copy e have is from the 15th century or whenever, and it could have been copied with errors. Impossible to know. rebuttal_labels::
