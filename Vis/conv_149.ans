[31mMakeSense64: As another editor pointed out already. The discussion is beyond silly.
Last week Zac was putting Ophiuchus (astrology) up for deletion, arguing that there shouldn't be an article about it.
Now that the article was kept, it is not enough to have an article about it, Zac insists that two other articles need sections about it. A hatnote link to Ophiuchus (astrology) is not sufficient. Does this editor know what he wants?
The difference between the "astronomical zodiac" and "astrological zodiac" is clearly explained in Zodiac, and is equal to the definition that  just brought from another source.
Ophiuchus is one of the 88 modern constellations, and that's all. And astronomers are not confused about it.
Whatever mumbo-jumbo some astrologers have dreamt up about Ophiuchus has its own space in Ophiuchus (astrology). The astrology of Ophiuchus is not that notable, it is only a rather recent fringe theory within astrology. So it is more than enough to link it from the hatnote here. It is not that important that it needs sections in several other articles. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMakeSense64: Note to Zac: The way you are cutting up people's responses with line by line replies, is completely unreadable. Maybe that's the purpose? rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mZachariel: Sorry if my replies were not clear enough - let me restate the situation here, so my points are perfectly lucid.
There is no difference between the "astronomical zodiac" and "astrological zodiac" - these are one and the same. As soon as you use the word 'zodiac' you are talking about the division of celestial longitude into twelve equal divisions of 30¬∞ each. You can talk about constellations that ''cross'' the zodiac, but you cannot talk about constellations that ''make'' the zodiac because the zodiac is only made of mathematical divisions, which begin with the first point of Aries. It is therefore not an ''astrological'' discussion to explain how many signs of the zodiac there are, and why Ophiuchus is not one of these. This matter does not need reference to an astrological section or an astrological page, because it is a matter of astronomical definition, and has been so for over 2500 years. Whether astronomers are confused or not, the general public are, and so will expect this page to give some kind of reliable explanation. The content that covers this issue is brief, reliable and factual and - although this has escaped your notice - does not make any astrological reference. (As a reminder, it reads as follows:)
Because of the partial overlap of the constellation Ophiuchus and the Sun's path upon which zodiacal longitude is based, Ophiuchus is sometimes mistakenly referred to as the '13th sign of the zodiac'. This is an innapropriate reference since the zodiac is a division of the ecliptic into twelve equal parts, initially originated for calendrical purposes. This makes the notion of a '13th sign' a mathematical impossibility. It is only correct to refer to Ophiuchus as one of the constellations which cross the zodiac; which does not constitute a zodiacal sign, of which all historical records acknowledge only twelve.[16] rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mMakeSense64: The lede on Zodiac disagrees with you. Quoting:
'In astronomy , the zodiac (Greek: Œ∂·ø≥Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∫œåœÇ, z≈çdiakos) is the ring of constellations that lines the ecliptic, which is the apparent path of the Sun across the celestial sphere over the course of the year. The paths of the Moon and planets also lie roughly within the ecliptic, and so are also within the constellations of the zodiac.''
'In astrology, the zodiac denotes those signs that divide the ecliptic into twelve equal zones of celestial longitude.''
So in astronomy it is the ring of '''constellations''', the 13 of them, including Ophiuchus.
While in astrology it is the '''signs''' dividing the ecliptic in 12 equal zones.
Like it or not, a clear distinction is being made. And the same distinction is made in the source that  cited.
Also note that Zodiac is one of the few articles that belongs both to astronomy and astrology category.
The section you want to bring in is completely astrological, because it clearly refers to zodiac in the astrological sense of 12 equal divisions.
Astrological considerations about the "sign" are irrelevant here because the article starts by saying "This article is about the constellation".
What is it you don't understand about that? rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mZachariel: The lede of the zodiac article is completely wrong in its opening definition. Unreferenced I note. I will add a citation request and request that the lede is corrected. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mMakeSense64: Let me point out that the word "zodiac" was not used in this article, until you brought in the astrology section. In the last sentence before your new section Ophiuchus is said to be a "zodiacal constellation" which gives an internal link to the section that explains the difference between "constellation" and "zodiacal sign" more than sufficiently. That makes your section redundant information here. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mAcabashi: (It's not essential to add citations to a lede, as what is there will be covered, explained and, most importantly, verified by reference further down. The lede sets out the article's salient points, per WP:MOS. If something in the lede is not mentioned and explained in the article it should be removed until it is, and the lede accordingly recast. The pertinence of additions is a different matter of course. A good place for you to add citations needed in the Zodiac article would be the 22 paragraphs that are in severe need of them) rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mZachariel: Yes, I can see that the page is another in need of attention.  I've made a proposal on the talk page and want to give contributing editors an oportunity to open discussion on the problems. Next week I'll propose a suggestion if no one else does that first. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mEnric Naval: (outside opinion, I spotted this at the COI noticeboard) Ophiuchus (astrology) is a WP:SPINOUT from this article, but the section should be much smaller, and it needs to put more weight in astronomic terms. Detailed debunking belongs to the astrology article. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[35mJc3s5h: I have restated JHunterJ's version to use well-defined astronomical terms. JHunterJ's version was unclear because
There is no official definition of "zodiacal longitude".
If we take "zodiacal longitude" to mean celestial longitude, then every celestial object and constellation has a (range of) celestial longitude, so the statement becomes meaningless. rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mJc3s5h: As far as I can tell, modern astronomers no longer offer precise definitions of "sign of the zodiac", and various media use the term in many different ways. Thus, the term is not well enough defined to decide of it is a mistake to describe Ophiuchus as the 13th sign of the zodiac. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mZachariel: Jc3s5h, I have undone your edit because it presents the information falsely.  The previous definition was too brief in my opinion but at least it wasn't inaccurate. The zodiac is an ecliptic-based frame of astronomical refrence that is used to define celestial latitude and longitude.  What you have written above shows misunderstanding and lack of knowledge so  if you want to propose an amendment based on sources, it would be a good idea to discuss here first with details of the sources for verification.  Please present a page number and not just a book so we can see why you are making the assumptions you are making.  It is my intention to correct the information on the zodiac page, BTW, before worrying too much about what this page says, but what is presented here should not be deliberately false or misleading. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
