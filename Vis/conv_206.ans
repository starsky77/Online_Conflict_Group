[31mD.Lazard: Elementary proof rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mD.Lazard: I have replaced section "Motivation" (which I have added myself to the article) by a section "Elementary proof". Here is the rationale.
I have been confused by the old version the article, and by the whole discussion, which suggested that the article was about infinite objects (infinite decimal representation). This confusion was supported by the algebraic pseudo proofs, which consist of manipulating infinite objects, without defining them neither the operations that are available for them. I have thus introduced the motivation for trying to explain why it is relevant to consider these object.
Presently, we have an accurate definition of 0.999..., which is conform with the history of the notation, and it appears that one does not need to manipulate infinite objects for proving 0.999... = 1. Therefore, this section "Motivation" seems unneeded.
On the other hand, the article deserves to have an elementary proof of this equality. By elementary, I mean using only properties of  and the operations of (finite) decimal numbers. This is such a proof, which is the object of this new section. This proof is very simple, and is also simple to explain, even to young kids, by a drawing on the number line. , could you adapt to this the file that I have kept.
I apologise that I have no source for this proof. It is so easy that I am pretty sure that such a source exists. In any case the algebraic pseudo-proofs are not sourced either.
It is amazing that so many people have discussed on 0.999... = 1 and the way to present this equality to kids, without realizing that it is easy to prove it without any reference to any calculus concept. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mCalbaer: That's much better than what it replaces, which I had a lot of problems with.  It might be somewhat daunting to some people - kicking off the article with a rigorous proof relying on a analytical property you don't prove, but instead link to - but it's a significant improvement nonetheless.  You are correct to fear an objection on the grounds of original research, but I wouldn't challenge it on those grounds.  I disagree that it doesn't rely on real analysis, since it assumes that no number is smaller than the inverse of an integer.  That's something that anyone accustomed to such proofs would take as a given, but doubters might not.  Nonetheless, I changed the portion about what's required for formal proof to say, "such as rigorous proofs relying on non-elementary techniques, properties, and/or disciplines" rather than mentioning real analysis specifically. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mJohnBlackburne: The article now is in a far worse state than a month ago. Previously it started with the most elementary of proofs, ones you might encounter in high school and which require only a knowledge of recurring decimals. But now the first proof is a far more advanced one, using notation and a degree of formalism not encountered until university. This makes the article far less accessible than it was. As I noted a week ago, it‚Äôs important this article is accessible as possible, as one of the few mathematical FA, on a topic easily understood by someone with high-school mathematics. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mDVdm: This "elementary proof" is unsourced, so it should be removed per wp:NOR. With a source, it is welcome. I also think that all the unsourced algebraic pseudo-proofs should either be backed by a solid source, or removed. Failing that, this discussion will ''never'' end. - rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mS≈Çawomir Bia≈Çy: The algebraic pseudoproofs appear in the sources cited in the discussion, by Richman, Byers, and Peressini and Peressini.  However, as I have said in the RfC, the section does not currently neutrally summarize those sources. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mDVdm: Ah yes, indeed, sorry. Could you try to create a few inline citations and stick them somewhere? TIA. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mDVdm: Of course, that other new section still ''really'' needs a solid source. - rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mS≈Çawomir Bia≈Çy: Surely the section on "Algebraic proofs" cannot possibly count as proofs without some version of the Archimedean property.  I'm all for making the article as accessible as possible, but not at the expense of obscuring the most important aspects of the subject. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[33mDmcq: The paper Does 0.999‚Ä¶ Really Equal 1? is fairly close in structure to this article. It gives a proof but only mentions that it used the Archimedean property a bit later. I agree that using the Archimedean property is a better route rather than going through the completeness property of the reals even though some people derive the Archimedean property from the completeness. rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mS≈Çawomir Bia≈Çy: Yes, that seems closer to the original structure.  However, I note that here (as in other such sources) the elementary proofs are not presented as altogether convincing.  ("maybe 0.333... doesn't equal 1/3", "skeptics might reject the equality by claiming that not all numbers can be subtracted from one another!")  He clearly presents the resolution of such apparent paradoxes by giving 0.999... a meaning as a limit.  Also, it seems to me that completeness cannot be totally omitted from the discussion, since it is completeness that ensures that the notation "0.999..." is meaningful as a number.  I note that some editors have been waving the "repeating decimals" magic wand (notably JohnBlackburne and Trovatore), but I am uncertain what repeating decimals means to them if not via limits and completeness.  I have concerns that completeness is also foregone in the new "Elementary proof" section.  There are algorithms for constructing rational numbers from repeating decimals, but the "Algebraic arguments" make no reference to these algorithms.  (And indeed, there is actually nothing to prove in that case:  is simply true by definition.) rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mCalbaer: I don't think any proof can be skeptic-proof; as I noted, the new proof requires one to buy that there's no positive number less than 1/x for all integers.  I'm reminded of skeptics talking about the mythical 0.000...1, being convinced that 1-0.999.. is that number, an infinite number of 0s followed by a 1, which presumably would be less than any 1/x.  Most other people don't seem to have a problem 0.333... = 1/3, so that demonstration helps bridge a gap for some people, even as if leaves other gaps open (i.e., assumed non-axiomatic properties).  In spite of the improvements of the past few days, I agree with JohnBlackburne that the article is in a worse state than a month ago.  I'm hoping that this is just a matter of transition, though.
Not using the word "proofs" for the series of equations at 0.999...#Algebraic proofs is one thing.  But leaving them until after a formal proof (deceptively called "elementary," as though it's easier to understand than those in 0.999...#Algebraic proofs) or a discussion of a tangentially related philosophical problem of Achilles and the tortoise is going to lose people.  (I call the now-removed tortoise section "tangentially related" because of its many differences: twos instead of tens, a moving target instead of a stationary target, and physics/philosophy versus pure math.)  The only question is how many people we'll lose.  It might be worthwhile to leave up the section to satisfy those who believe it's important and to see what type of reaction we get for it.  I think it's interesting, but the OR and readability concerns remain.  (And "original research" isn't just an arbitrary concern; if no one else has used this to bridge understanding, there might be a reason.  After all, we're coming from the other side of understanding, trying to put ourselves in the shoes of someone who doesn't buy 0.999...=1, which is a different position than a math educator who has to deal with this problem all the time.) rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mS≈Çawomir Bia≈Çy: Except the algebraic proofs don't actually prove the theorem, which is that one is the smallest number greater than all of the finite truncations 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc.  In this respect, they are manifestly deficient.  If anyone wants to clarify what actually is proven by the algebraic proofs, I would be happy to comment at greater length. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mD.Lazard: For those who find that the elementary proof is too difficult, I have split this section into two subsections "intuitive explanation" and "formal proof". This allows the reader, who does not really care of proofs, skipping  the formal proof. Although this is not the objective of this article, this may allow also helping some reader to better understand the difference between a proof and an explanation. rebuttal_labels::
