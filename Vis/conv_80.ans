[31m27.32.152.121: Overuse of Quotes in Lead rebuttal_labels:: 
[31m27.32.152.121: The quoted phrases in the lead are misleading and detract from the readability of the text. If these are indeed quotes, I could not find them in the cited source (try finding "sexual brokenness that may be healed through faith in Jesus Christ." in [7]). If they are being used to say something is so-called, then what is subjective about "renouncing homosexuality"? If you look up renounce in the dictionary, that is exactly what they are asking people to do. What should be done here?  â€” Preceding unsigned comment added by rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mJenova20: They are quotes because they are from the organisation themselves and are magical claims of curing gay people of being. If they were not in quotes then they would be in Wikipedia's voice and violate WP:Weight, thus having to be removed completely. All organizations tend to have a mission statement or similar information and notable quotes. "Renouncing homosexuality" is a perfect example - it is their words, not ours. Renouncing is very controversial in this case since sexuality is not an addiction or a habit you can "renounce" and HA leaders themselves admit that homosexuality is incurable. The organization only live on because people and churches still ignore that and fund them anyway. If i missed anything there then let me know. Thanks ''' (email)''' rebuttal_labels:: 
[34m202.93.155.225: You missed any mention of the missing quote, "sexual brokenness that may be healed through faith in Jesus Christ." I don't think anything about the word renounce suggests that homosexuality is a habit. Can you clarify? My point was that it should be in Wikipedia's voice as there's nothing misleading about describing what they urge people to do. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mJenova20: Sexual brokenness" is a quote, so we do not put it in Wikipedia's voice. And the part about healing with Jesus is not a scientific or the mainstream view, so it does not go in Wikipedia's voice as it would violate WP:Weight. Wikipedia uses science and reliable sources for articles. Conservapedia is the one that uses the Bible and quotes from magical and mythical creatures. Did i get it all? Thanks ''' (email)''' rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31m27.32.152.121: Right, so if "sexual brokenness" is a quote, don't you think the quote should be reined in a little so as not to mislead and/or make the paragraph unreadable? The part about healing through faith in Jesus is not scientific, but the sentence starts with "HA regards sexuality as". I don't think anybody would confuse this with Wikipedia's voice. You did not clarify what you believe constitutes weight the phrase "renounce homosexuality". rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31m27.32.152.121: One more thing. Regarding the voice issue, I think you might be referring to this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view
You'll note that the "HA regards sexuality as..." sentence is practically identical to "genocide has been described by John X as..." in the section titled "Explanation of the Neutral Point of View". They do not recommend that half of the sentence is quoted.  â€” Preceding unsigned comment added by rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mJenova20: They're still quotes after that section, hence the speech marks. With a topic like this making such outlandish claims we have to be careful to explain those without putting it in Wikipedia's voice. And as you can see there are multiple policies to adhere to with something like this. So we must carefully explain what the company does without making it seem factual, as the citations from the company themselves cannot be used for that. WP:NPOV, WP:WEIGHT, WP:Reliable...there's a few to be aware of. The fact of the matter is that we cannot put these things into Wikipedia's voice, but we must explain what the company does. So we're at the situations where there's a few quotes. They're not causing harm and there's not many of them though. Thanks ''' (email)''' rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mJenova20: Plus, 22 words is a short sentence, not half of the lede. That's how much is quoted, and i'm sure even the Born This Way Foundation features more than that...Thanks ''' (email)''' rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
