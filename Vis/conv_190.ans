[31mGaaarg: JAH Throne music rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mGaaarg: The article intro currently includes this line: "The music style is sometimes referred to as '''JAH Throne music''' in Rastafari contexts. In the Caribbean, the heavier forms of reggae are also sometimes known as '''Rockers music'''."
I've never heard reggae being referred to as "JAH Throne music", and a quick Google search reveals only 451 hits. Rockers refers to a "sound" or a sub-genre that was popular in the later 70s in Jamaica, but it is not something that merits a mention in the introduction of a whole music genre. If no one objects, I'm going to remove it. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mTil Eulenspiegel: So, now you're deleting information on the basis that there are 451 google hits, and you've never heard of it?  Gee, if there are only 451 google hits and you've never heard of it, I guess that means it must not really exist then, right?  Sorry, but I DO object, especially part of what you deleted included a reference.  This ref was not always in the intro and might not need to be there, but please do not undo the hard work others have done in complying with all the references and citations requests, just because in your perception of experience you are not familiar with something.  Thankyou. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Stating your stance
[34mMigglesworth: I am going to go with Gaaarg on this one.  This page is intended to be a general introduction to reggae.  I do not feel that having the term JAH THRONE (although it may be a perfectly valid term in reggae), in the page would lead folks in the right direction.  I think we should keep it out for now.  With all due respect, please post your motivation for including this term along with the term "rockers".  Regarding the comment on citations and the amount of work involved, sometimes it is hard work conforming to the standards of this encyclopedia and sometimes it gets erased outright.  Just because something is difficult doesn't give it precedence to stay in the page.  After your motivation is posted and it seems that the page would be lacking without term JAH THRONE, then it should be reinstated. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mTil Eulenspiegel: The info that was Reliably Sourced should not have ben blanked just because some have a low opinion of it.  There has to be a very good reason for blanking out information from Reliable Sources, and "because I / we don't think it's important" usually doesn't cut it, being of course a POV.   You are free to look for contradictory references if there are any, but do not blank the ones that are there.  This is an encyclopedia that aims to be comprehensive, so we are trying to include MORE reliable information about the subject, not less. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mGaaarg: I've looked a bit for sources that would say reggae music is known as "JAH Throne music" and I can't find any. The term is not mentioned in the introductory chapter of ''The Rough Guide to Reggae'' (3rd edition), and it's not in the index. Personally, I can't recall seeing it used anywhere and I've read several books on reggae. Unless someone can dig up a reliable source, it should be removed. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mGaaarg: Regarding the rockers part; the source that is used does in fact not state that "in the Caribbean, the heavier forms of reggae are also sometimes known as Rockers music" or anything to that effect IMO. "In rockers, the bass was as heavily amplified as ever and continued to provide the basic background throb—reggae's heartbeat. [...] In some types of heavy reggae (especially in instrumental or "dub" music) the bass takes over the prominent role [...]" (''Cut 'n' Mix: Culture, Identity and Caribbean Music'' p.67). Nothing in that text about "rockers" being a term used in the Caribbean (as in, outside Jamaica), and the heavy part seems to be mostly about dub music. — rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mTil Eulenspiegel: So, I take it that since you can't find it on Google, therefore you do not believe this is true, and think that someone made it up out of thin air just to confuse you...? rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mGaaarg: That's not really what I said in my message above... -) Anyways, see WP:VERIFY: "Editors should provide a reliable source for quotations and for any material that is challenged or is likely to be challenged, or the material may be removed.". — rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mTil Eulenspiegel: And this is why wikipedia has the reputation it has, because of armchair experts who delete anything they can't find on google. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mGaaarg: I don't know why you keep assuming Google is my only source. I gave you another source above, but here's more   . I just think it stands to reason that since several books on the subject reggae don't mention the term, it's simply not in common use and hence not notable enough to be mentioned in this article; and I know Google "hit counts" aren't a reliable source, but it can give at least a little indication of if something is used often or not. Have you seen "JAH Throne music" used anywhere? Don't feel like I'm attacking you, I just think the information is false, and shouldn't be included in Wikipedia. — rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mTil Eulenspiegel: Maybe if you had ever spent time in the Caribbean, you wouldn't think this "information is false".  But now, thanks to Google, anyone from anywhere in the world can find 400 hits for a phrase and claim to be an expert from their armchair and say therefore it doesn't exist and that somebody made it up.  Guess ya gotta love 'em. rebuttal_labels:: DH0: Name calling/hostility
[34mMigglesworth: Oh man.  Still there, still in BOLD for some reason.  The same logic used to insult armchair experts can be used to infer that just because someone has lived in the Caribbean and heard the term JAH THRONE in reference to reggae from 400 people, doesn't make them an expert on reggae either.  Like Gaarg said, there is no attacking just trying to get the most reliable and well known facts together.Is this an edit war?  If so this is my first.  I don't like the feeling. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mCziltang Brone: I've deleted the sentence in question. The use of this "JAH Throne" should not be included, much less in bold (sheesh!), unless specific citation can be given for it. The burden of evidence is on those wanting to '''include''' the term, not those asking for it to be removed. This is basic people. You have to prove something ''exists'', not prove its ''non-existence''. I will stand by this edit. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mMigglesworth: One more thing.  Rockers music.  I understand that it is cited and all that.  It is in the wrong place.  One recommendation would be to create a section for other names of reggae across the world.  That would give a good opportunity to include rockers and many other names like "boom-boom music" and the locations they come from like "Jeret's parents house".  Joking aside, seriously, if you want something in there like other names for reggae across the world, create the category and add it to it.  Don't just shove it in the second introductory paragraph. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mCziltang Brone: I agree with  on this. The introductory paragraph should be just that  introductory. It should be of a summary nature for a topic as broad as Reggae. It is not appropriate to include synonyms or culturally/geographically equivalent terms. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
