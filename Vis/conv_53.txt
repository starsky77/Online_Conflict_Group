{'text': 'It\'s borderline, leaning towards revert.  On the one hand, the information wasn\'t put in with a simple use of the "undo" or "rollback" buttons.  However, the information re-added was clearly a word for word restoral of a section from a few days ago, and when it was re-added, it removed some  tags, but without adequately addressing the concerns. Since the conditions are fairly new, we can write it off as "the editor didn\'t know", but if such a thing happened again, then it would be regarded as a violation of restrictions. In the future, a better way to handle it would be to move more slowly, adding a few sentences at a time, and trying to find a compromise version, without just doing a copy/paste restoral.', 'username': 'Elonka', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Providing clarification']}

I didn\'t use those buttons so therefore I didn\'t revert by that \'\'reasoning\'\'.
