We do have to allow a certain amount of latitude, while at the same time getting the message across that edit-warring is unacceptable. We also have to ask ourselves, is there any merit in his or her case? Having read the article, and looked at some of the edits that were reverted, I believe it does have some merit. The question that is being answered in the article – and it is reflected in the title of this thread – is whether there is today a \'\'scholarly consensus\'\' in favour of her existence, but it is reasonable and right also to ask the question, are there people in the 21st century that give the idea credence? Thus, we have Peter Stanford, a reputable writer, Donna Cross, a novelist notable enough to be reported by ABC News, and the \'\'Daily Mail\'\', a well-known British tabloid, all saying they believe she existed, at least on some level. Stanford is included in the "Modern analysis and critique" section, Cross\'s opinion is not mentioned and she is relegated to the "In fiction" section, and the \'\'Mail\'\' is rejected out of hand. I think that both WP:NPOV and WP:DUE are consistent with including all three in the article, and I think there would be no harm in reflecting that in the lead.
