If you feel like spending your time propping up some semi-elitist internet scam, I sure hope your getting paid for it. I am glad you can also quote an elitist English order, congrats on your French. You are the best Sherlock Holmes on Wikipedia. So feel free to continue trying to delete a section on a Gender Discrimination case that is pending in a federal court. I am sure that helps you sleep at night. Just cause you are self proclaimed high wizard of wikipedia or whatever you think you are doesn't mean I haven't put up valid current sources of relevant material.
