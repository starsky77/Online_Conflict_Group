[31mFreeatlastChitchat: added some content which I deleted. My reason is Wikipedia:Independent sources says that An independent source is a source that has no vested interest in a written topic and therefore it is commonly expected to describe the topic from a disinterested perspective. But the content that was added came from an author who has been writing hate literature against the entire community since he started writing, also the website in the reference is one which ONLY published hate literature against the community. I don't think that these are reliable sources. If you do not agree please discuss here. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mXtremedood: I see that you have once again removed a valuable and crucial criticism in that section. I have checked the sources and no where is hate promoted against anybody. I have also provided four sources. The criticism is rather simple, but necessary to maintain a neutral atmosphere. Many critics of the so called "sun and moon eclipse prophecy" maintain that the eclipses never happened on the dates provided in the "prophecy." These are the four sources of criticism that I have referenced.
As I have stated, I have checked these four distinct and separate sources and no where have I read hate speech. They make rational statements pertaining to the issue at hand. The statement, "Some critics also claim that the lunar eclipse did not occur on the first night of Ramadan and the solar eclipse did not occur on the middle day of the month as detailed in the prophecy" should therefore remain and not be removed. The questioning of the veracity of the dates of the eclipses is a crucial issue that should not be ignored. Let us examine the four sources: 1) "FLAWS IN THE AHMADIYYA ECLIPSE THEORY" is written by Dr David McNaughton. David examines "Ahmadiyya" claims and criticizes their conclusions and approaches. 2) " Exposing Qadiani Falsehood on the Internet and on TV - The Fraud of Eclipses" is written by the organization 'Idara Dawat-O-Irshad' in the United States, and they are operating freely and have not to my knowledge been accused of promoting hate or intolerance. They make criticisms of the "sun and moon prophecy" theory. 3) "Muhammad is the Last Prophet" by Sayyid Saeed Akhtar Rizvi is published by the Bilal Muslim Mission of Tanzania, which is an active organization. They are reputable amongst the Shia community and are not considered a hate group. The statement expressing the position of these critics of the prophecy theory should therefore remain. We have Sunni, Shia, non-Muslim, etc. critics who disagree with the "Ahmadiyya" position of the so called prophecy. Disagreeing in this manner is not hate speech. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mFreeatlastChitchat: as far as your statement that "FLAWS IN THE AHMADIYYA ECLIPSE THEORY" is written by Dr David McNaughton so is reliable. Well the eclipse occurred and was documented by newspapers as well as other journals so saying that it did not occur is like saying that a historic even did not occur. You cannot contest the occurrence once something has happened. Your second statement that Idara Dawat-O-Irshad is not spewing hate literature is not true. You can look at their website and you will see hundreds of hate statements. This has been discussed on this very talkpage before you should read the entire talk page before commenting on validity of such a source. Your third source is invalid because Manzur Chinioti is a hate preacher and I can cite at least five hundred links to his hate statements. However your fourth source seems ok to me now that I have read it, I would like to apologize for removing it, i should not have bundeled it up with others. Feel free to add the content from the fourth source i.e "Muhammad is the Last Prophet" by Sayyid Saeed Akhtar Rizvi rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mXtremedood: There is ample evidence to counter your historicity claim. I also do not see any hate speech in those sources, however I think those two sources are sufficient to get the point across and I have therefore removed the Idara Dawat-O-Irshad and Manzur Chinioti (because it was not in English) references. The statement "Some critics also claim that the lunar eclipse did not occur on the first night of Ramadan and the solar eclipse did not occur on the middle day of the month as detailed in the prophecy" and the remaining references are however valid and should remain. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mFreeatlastChitchat: There is ample evidence to counter your historicity claim.Really? Well you should visit http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEsearch/SEsearchmap.php?Ecl=18940406, I put it in url so that everyone can see that the site belongs to NASA. So please provide any source valid enough to counter NASA or else please remove the historicity content. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mXtremedood: I have checked the url you provided and it does nothing to strengthen your claim, rather thanks for providing that link to me as it disproves your claim entirely. Let us examine the initial prophecy: "For our Mahdi there are two signs which have never appeared before since the creation of the heavens and the earth, namely the moon will be eclipsed on the first night in Ramadan and the sun will be eclipsed on the middle day in the same month of Ramadhan, and these signs have not appeared since God created the heavens and the earth." According to this statement, there should be a lunar eclipse on the 1st day of Ramadan and a solar eclipse on the middle day of the month. NASA claims no such thing happened, you can check the data. According to data the solar eclipse occurred on the 28th day of Ramadan, not the 15th and the lunar eclipse occurred on the 13th day of Ramadan, not the first. According to the Islamic Finder date conversion, April 06, 1894 converts to Ramadan 29th, 1311 AH rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mFreeatlastChitchat: This talk page has something written at the VERY TOP you should read it before scrolling down. It says that this is not a forum to discuss the topic in general "This is not a forum for general discussion of the article's subject." Please stay on topic about the sourcing.
You said that "There is ample evidence to counter your historicity claim", whereby you meant that there is AMPLE evidence to suggest that the eclipse did not occur and therefore the website blog/article by David McNaughton is a reliable source.
I countered this by saying that NASA has shown and accepted that the eclipse did indeed occur. Therefore the historicity of the event cannot be challenged without some powerful evidence.
What you wrote has nothing to do with this. Please stay on topic and discuss this. Here on WP we do not discuss anyones claims, we just create content based on sources, anything else is original research. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH5: Counterargument
[32mXtremedood: You misunderstand my statements. You are the one bringing the primary research with your NASA website. I agree Wikipedia is not the place for this, but this was a necessary thing for me to do to counter your point that your website was a source for your claim, which it is not. NASA data in no way supports the "Ahmadiyya" prophecy claim. I request you to stop bringing original research into this. I have already provided you with four references containing proofs and views by a variety of sources that counter the fulfillment of the prophecy claim. Remember, the prophecy itself claims that the lunar eclipse should happen on the 1st day of Ramadan and the solar eclipse on the middle day of the month (15th). There are currently two views being shared on the article as of now, the view of critics claiming that it is weak and the view of "Ahmadis" that it is sound. There however is no information (as of now) on the article indicating a crucial view that the prophecy was not fulfilled in the first place. The criticism that the prophecy has not been fulfilled should be shared and there are two major points for this view, the first being that the solar eclipse and lunar eclipses did not occur on the days prophecized and the second point is that the prophecy itself applies prior to the arrival of the Mahdi, not after. This is clearly expressed on page 100 of "Muhammad is the Last Prophet" by Sayyid Saeed Akhtar Rizvi. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mFreeatlastChitchat: You are again muddling up the issue. Keep the discussion simple and you wont be "misunderstood". To simplify this discussion let us discuss one point at one time. Let us begin by discussing the simplest thing first. i.e the historicity of the event. You are saying that there is someone who says that the eclipse did not occur and you have given the source of David McNaughton. You have said that as "There is ample evidence to counter your historicity claim", so according to you the content added to the article should show that the eclipse may not even have occurred. I am countering this my providing you with data from NASA, which is more reliable than a website article. So what is your counter argument to this? You can either say that "ok" the eclipse did occur as NASA says, or you can say that "NO" it did not occur and then provide some source which is as authentic as, if not more than, NASA. Let us first discuss this then move on to other points. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mXtremedood: I am being clear and concise. NASA never shows that a lunar eclipse occurred on the 1st day of Ramadan and never shows that a solar eclipse happened on the 15th. The date on the NASA website is likely on the 29th of Ramadan, according to Gregorian to Hijri calendar conversions, NOT on the 1st or 15th. The content shows that the eclipse did NOT happen on the 1st and 15th days of Ramadan as described by the prophecy. The content is clear. Therefore the criticism should remain. Wikipedia is not the place for such religious propaganda. Also, do not bring about such original research as well. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mFreeatlastChitchat: HISTORICITY means that the event occurred or not. Either you accept that or you say that it did not occur. This is why I wanted to talk about this first. If you admit that the eclipse did indeed occur, even if it occurred on the 29th, you cannot bring the David McNaughton source into the mix because his claims are refuted by NASA data. Simple as that. We are not going to discuss the prophecy I already told you that, we will just put in what "reliable" sources tell us about its occurrence. and the most reliable of sources ,NASA, says that it did occur. The first and fifteenth of the month do not have any possibility of an eclipse. There has never been any contest about those days. The hadith clearly uses a pronoun to say the eclipse will occur in the middle or the first of "the possible" days and nights.So please either agree with NASA or present some argument against their data. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mXtremedood: Nobody denies solar and lunar eclipses occur. The issue is not whether or not the solar or lunar eclipses occur. It is scientific fact that they occur. The issue is if they occurred in 1894/1895 on the date outlined by the prophecy itself (the 1st and 15th of Ramadan respectivly). NASA shows it did not happen on these dates. The four sources I have indicated also say the same thing. Therefore, the claim to the fulfillment of the prophecy is false. However, "Ahmadis" may claim otherwise. I am proposing a neutral and impartial representation of the views on this article, which includes three criticisms on the article, 1) the veracity of the prophecy itself (which is already on the article), 2) the indication that critics do not believe the eclipses occured on the 1st and 15th respectively, and 3) according to critics the prophecy is referring to before the arrival of the Mahdi, not after. I believe I have demonstrated quite rationally and soundly that my points are valid. Your statements are quite clear and demonstrate your incoherance, if you have nothing else to say I believe it is now time to remedy the situation and fix this portion of the article. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mFreeatlastChitchat: The article is ok as it is. The prophecy does not say that the sun and moon will be eclipsed on the 1st and the fifteenth. You should read the Arabic prophecy before making such a claim. It does not mention dates. It mentions that the eclipse will occur on the first of the nights i.e the first of the nights when an eclipse "can occur" and the sun on the middle day i.e middle of the days when the eclipse can occur. Why will you want to put "the indication that critics do not believe the eclipses occurred on the 1st and 15th respectively," when there is no claim from the person Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Sahib Alaih Salam that they occurred on these dates? He claimed that the moon was eclipsed on the first of its possible nights and the sun was eclipsed on the middle one of its possible days. This was his claim. As I have rendered your first two points moot. let us move onto the third. Which source would you like to use for it? and what content would you like to put in. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
