[31mAlex Bakharev: Protected rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mAlex Bakharev: I have temporarily protected the article, so you could discuss your edit conflict on the talk page, before the edit warring. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mAmiDaniel: Thank you for protecting. I really didn't want to get involved in this dispute, but I kept seeing numerous reverts come up while I was on recent changes patrol and initiated a discussion with Xebat. Frankly, I'd say I tend to agree with the anti-Xebat crowd, yet I nonetheless find it inappropriate to repeatedly delete his dispute tags. I really wish everyone would just follow WP:1RR in these cases: Xebat tags the article, the tag is deleted, the tag is restoredleave the tag in place. He honestly has not been given adequate time to explain his complaint, and none of the editors here have shown him any respect or civility. He, on the other hand, was equally uncivil by adding a ridiculous number of inappropriate tags to the article with the intent of undermining its ethical appeal and making a point. As there clearly is a dispute about the factuality and neutrality of the article, I urge the editors here, after the article is unprotected, to leave Xebot's tag in place until a resolution is reachedeither through an overwhelming consensus, his concession, or mediation. It is most definitely inappropriate to repeatedly remove these tags only a couple of hours after they were originally posted. Leave them in place for at least a few days, and if everyone agrees that Xebot has made no valid statement of a dispute, then you can delete them without being rash and cruel. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mAucaman: I think  deserves more credit than he's been given. Some users here try to push for certain terms and ideas to appear in the article not by concensus or cooperation but by carrying out constant revert wars and repeatedly taking off the dispute tags. This has got to stop. The article is on Iranian peoples but the source justifying its definition here comes from an article on Kurds. No sources have been provided that give a consistent definition of who Iranian peoples are and this is of great concern. Instead of looking for comprehensive sources and presenting them here, they have decided to just define things the way they see it and then look for (incomplete) sources justifying one sentence but at the same time contradicting another. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mSouthernComfort: Incorrect. There is a consensus and the sources clearly define what is meant by "Iranian peoples". Please see WP:V, and as for your other comments directed towards specific editors, please see WP:CIVIL. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[35mKhoikhoi: I agree, users such as Xebat have asked for sources that say that an Iranian ethno-linguistic group exists - we provided it to him and Aucaman but both rejected it saying "it's about the Kurds". Yes the subject of the article is about the Kurds, but it still acknowleges the existance of an Iranian ethno-linguistic group. rebuttal_labels:: 
[33mZereshk: Is Xebat a sock puppet for ? Just wondering. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mAucaman: Again, just because '''Kurds''' are an ethno-linguistic group it doesn't mean you can call ''Iranians'' an ethno-linguistic group. An ethno-linguistic group is an ethnic group that shares a common language. Kurds have that. "Iranians" don't. Iranian is a general linguistic group. I can't believe you're bring this same issue back up. Makes me wonder if you're reading the source correctly. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[37mManiF: This is what the source says: "The Kurds, an '''Iranian ethno-linguistic''' group'''like''' Persians, Lurs, Baluch and Bakhtiari". The source clearly indicates that Iranian peoples (Kurds, Persians, Lurs, Baluch and Bakhtiari) are a related ethnolinguistic group. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31m59.167.12.160: I am not sure why some people think it is obvious that Iranian Turks are not Iranian peoples!!! Some of us do not think so. So there is no consensus. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31m59.167.12.160: Therefore, I request protection until we settle this dispute. We need to be clear here. Either we think Iranian peoples is a language based grouping, then fine, merge this article with Iranian languages. Or we think there is more than linguistic link. Then Iranian Turkic people are Iranian peoples. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31m59.167.12.160: I unprotected the article as I, as a party to dispute, could not protect the article. However, be nice and do not remove my edit until there is a consensus rebuttal_labels:: 
[31m59.167.12.160: against my above arguments. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31m59.167.12.160: There has been quite a few editing and deleting going on recently on including Iranian Turkic people. So please do not start an edit warware. It is not fair. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31m59.167.12.160: When you are respected, try to respect others. Something might be obvious for you, but if you think '''objectively rather than subjectively''', it might not be so. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mPersian Magi: I do agree. Azeris and Iranian Turks are as Iranian culturally and ethnically as any Lur, Mazandarani etc. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mTombseye: Okay, again Iranian peoples does not, in the context of this article, mean the country of modern Iran's population as a whole. Iranian peoples refers to people who speak an Iranian language first and foremost and then other factors are discussed. Since the Azeris do not speak an Iranian language they do not qualify as an Iranian or Iranic people. And we've already debated all of these issues ad nauseum. Look up Iranian peoples on the web and you'll find that the Azeris are not included. Their sharing modern Iran or a Persian culture or most aspects is, again, another matter that is discussed in the Azeri people page and on the culture of Iran page. this article is quite specific and the appellation of Iranian peoples is in reference to the various tribes that spoke Iranian languages and their descendents, however putative. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36m203.48.45.194: Guess our disagreement is in the term "modern Iran" and also the title of this article.  Firstly, Azeris and Iranian Turks built Iran as a country together with the rest of Iran. If a thousand years ago is still considered modern time. then you are correct. Please note that Iran has been integrated and disintegrated quite a few times, namely, before and after, Cyrus, Ashkanian, Sasanian, Samanian, Ghaznavian, Kharazmian, Safavian (500 years ago) , Afshar, Zand, Qajar. You can see how many times of those were Turks. At least from Safavids on, they were not considered other people than Iranians. (Do you think Shah Ismail or Nader Shah was a non-Iranian at his time?). rebuttal_labels:: 
[36m203.48.45.194: Secondly, If you are talking linguistics here, then the title of the article is misleading and inappropriate and the article should merge with Iranian languages. Iranian peoples are Iranian '''peoples''' and not "speakers of Iranian languages". rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mTombseye: The term Iranian is used by academics to denote a group of people as well its modern usage as applied to the people of modern Iran. Terminology changes over millenia and called many names, often those of ruling dynasties. As noted at the top of the article, Iranian peoples is not about the Iranian demographics or Iran itself, but simply parts of its population who speak Iranian languages. I'm talking about the ancient movements of the Iranic peoples as well as their languages, some commonalities and differences and the most common accepted definition that does not include Turkic speaking peoples. I think the only way to resolve this is a vote to see if people think inclusion of Turkic peoples is warranted or not. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mPersian Magi: Please clarify who "acadmeics" are. I am guessing you are not refering to internet pages with subjective contents but rather refering to University text books and known scholars using the term exactly the same and for the same meaning. rebuttal_labels::
