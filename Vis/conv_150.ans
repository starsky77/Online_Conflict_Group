Knjiga o Kosovu isn't RS:
by  Jasna Dragoviƒá)
Despite its relative backwardness and isolation, Kosovo‚Äôs status as a focus  for Serbian nationalism and flash point for armed conflict has generated a large literature describing the region‚Äôs history. The Kosovo problem is evoked from a Serbian perspective in Dimitrije Bogdanoviƒá, Knijga o Kosovu.
author of a very influential study called Knjiga o Kosovu, which was published among the numerous revisionist writings of 1985 was Dimitrije Bogdanovic
Bogdan Popovic was a conservative politician and essayist of the interbellum period in Serbia i.e not RS.
Milosevic's propaganda newspaper isn't RS. Btw the article constantly explains to the reader the ''national rights'' of Serbia.
As no part of that area was ever ceded to Serbia there is no territorial succession. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mAntidiskriminator: The title of the artcle is defined according to "Wikipedia:Naming conventions. ''"An otherwise notable topic has not yet received much attention in the English-speaking world... If this happens, follow the conventions of the language in which this entity is most often talked about"''.
Will you please provide link to the RSN which defined Knjiga o Kosovu as non-rs. Btw, the links you provided talk about authors opinion about Kosovo, not Durres or Durres County.
Will you please provide a link to the policy which support your claim that conservative politicians and esseyists of the interbellum period in Serbia are not RS? Or to RSN which support such claim?
The text written by contemporary historian ƒåedomir Antiƒá is published in Veƒçernje novosti in 2010, four years after Milo≈°eviƒá died and ten years after he lost all his power.
The word "ceded" is not used in the article. On the contrary, it is clearly emphasized that this county was established " on the part of the territory of Albania occupied from Ottoman Empire during the First Balkan War."
Taking above mentioned in consideration, there are no POV issues proven or disputes, so please remove tags you added to this article. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mZjarriRrethues: This is not a subject that hasn't received ''much'' attention, but nobody has ever even documented it as an event. Even in Yugoslav works the Slavic translation appears only once in Knjiga o Kosovu. Please stick to RS and NPOV i.e you can't write an article about the activities of the Serbian army and use only Serbian dubious sources by authors, which are labeled as nationalists/revisionists etc. by everyone else. Btw you have only one sources mentioning the phrase, however, as there's no documentation in English you shouldn't translate Okrug to match the English translation of the modern county.¬† rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[32mAntidiskriminator: I still can conclude that I was right when I wrote that there are no POV issues proven or any disputes of factual accuracy. Please remove tags you added to this article. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mZjarriRrethues: In order to remove the tags I'll have to remove most of the article's content. That being said the topic exists only in wikipedia and isn't documented at all anywhere else. At the very most there's a sentence in the partisan work Knjiga o Kosovu about this okrug. Btw the infobox will go too, because there was no intermediate rule between Ottoman Empire and independent Albania.¬† rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[34mGaius Claudius Nero: Since the name had to be made up by Antid, it's clear that there is no such thing as a Serbian Durres County. As far as I can tell, Durres was just part of an occupied zone, much like northern Iraq was occupied by the Americans where they set up their own governors (Jay Garner) and the Americans claimed that Iraqis were celebrating their occupation by a foreign country. The parallels aren't absolute but it would be ridiculous to claim that northern Iraq is/was the 51st American state. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
