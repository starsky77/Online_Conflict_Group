[31m72Dino: Recreational drugs rebuttal_labels:: 
[31m72Dino: This may seem like a small item, but it's important and I don't want to edit war over it.  I do not see where Focus on the Family uses the term "recreational drugs".  There is nothing recreational about illegal drug use or abuse of legal drugs.  It diminishes the seriousness of the issue and is not the term used among organizations like this.  I think "drug abuse" is basically what the organization is against and that is the terminology I propose. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mStillStanding-247: I don't think that anyone supports drug ''abuse''. As I explained, legality really isn't the issue, since the question is often ''whether'' it should be legal, and FotF opposes these drugs even when they are legal. The term "recreational drugs" is meant to be neutral, not lighthearted. It refers to drugs used for non-medical purposes. Take a look a Recreational drug use and you'll see. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31m72Dino: I have read the article.  If you can show me where Focus on the Family uses the term, I will concede.  Otherwise, recreational drug use = drug abuse for most religious organizations, and drug abuse is, in my opinion, a more correct term. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mBelchfire: Gotta go with the best available source on this one.  FotF says "drug abuse".  Somebody who wants to show that FotF (or any Christian organization) draws a distinction between legal and illegal, has their work cut out for them.  ALL use of intoxicants is seen as "drug abuse".  There is no "recreational" use that fits their principles.  - rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mStillStanding-247: Even if FotF is convinced that all recreational drug use is drug abuse, that doesn't mean we get to endorse that view. Drug abuse is, by definition, negative. The people who want to legalize marijuana (and this appears to be a clear majority of the USA) would never say they support drug abuse. But it's clear that they support recreational drugs, which makes it a neutral term. To be quite frank, I just don't see a better way of expressing it. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31m72Dino: The FOTF did not say they were against "recreational drug use", they are against "drug abuse" per Belchfire's edit below.  We should use their terminology to describe their position, not the terminology and interpretation of one WP editor. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mBelchfire: We should use their terminology.  Now where have I heard that before?  - rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mStillStanding-247: Thank you again for supporting my argument. What they ''call'' drug abuse is what is neutrally termed recreational drug use. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31m72Dino: If they state they are against drug abuse, that's what should be put in the article. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mBelchfire: I'm sorry, but WP:NPOV prevents us from doing that, as it would require '''Wikipedia''' to agree with their apparent claim that all recreational use is abuse. There is no reliable source for such a thing, which would lead us to violate WP:RS. Really, "recreation drugs" is very neutral and supported. I don't see any better alternative.
Consensus is to go with the wording from the source: "drug abuse"  Case closed.  -
Sorry, but you have no authority to declare any such thing. Instead of listening to you, I'll listen to WP:NPOV and WP:RS. If you don't like it, go complain on the content dispute resolution page. I'm confident your view will be rejected. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31m72Dino: That is your description rather than that of FOTF.  It is not up to you to interpret their statements of their position. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mStillStanding-247: No, it's not my view, it's the view of reliable sources. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31m72Dino: Change.org is not a reliable source so I didn't bother looking at that.  The Denver Post is an RS, but I see no mention of drugs in that article. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mBelchfire: You don't see it because... wait for it... there is no mention of drugs in that article.  He doesn't have a source, he's just engaging in vexation tactics, for what reason, we can only guess.  It's not necessary to trouble yourself - as I pointed out a while ago, we already have consensus and the only reason the article hasn't been updated is that I've already done my share of reversions for the time being.  Ignore the nonsense about "not having authority".  - rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31m72Dino: (ec)The Los Angeles Times states the FOTF handles "problems of chemical substance abuse", which is also an acceptable term. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mBelchfire: I would also be OK with "substance abuse", if you feel that is appropriate.  In fact, it might be even better.  Just so we avoid the qualifier "recreational", which we both find problematic.  - rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mStillStanding-247: Same problem: nobody supports ''abuse''. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31m72Dino: What does it matter if no one supports substance abuse?  Either get rid of it or use the term "abuse" as stated by FOTF and by the LA Times. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mBelchfire: If that's the remaining counter-argument - that nobody supports substance abuse - then we have a winner, and "substance abuse" is our term of choice.  The counter-argument fails ''ab initio'' because MANY people and organizations support the abuse of illegal substances.  - rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mStillStanding-247: You keep speaking for yourself as if you speak for others. Why? rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mStillStanding-247: It matters because that makes it a biased description. It's not that FotF opposes abuse, since ''everyone'' does, it's that is opposes recreational use on the non-objective basis that all use is abuse. This means that following their bias would violate WP:NPOV. That's why the LA Times was careful to attribute the drug abuse idea as "according to Dobson". Of course, if I were to phrase it as "what it considers drug abuse", I fully expect that Belchfire would launch into an edit war against "weasel words". rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31m72Dino: It is the description from the organization and a reliable source.  You may not add your own original research and interpretation of the sources.  Either it should be removed or use the term used by those sources.  Do you want yet another DRN on this article? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mStillStanding-247: No, actually, it's not. This isn't complicated: there is no RS for FotF being against actual drug abuse. There are many RS for FotF being against recreational drug use on the basis of considering it to be abuse. That's why the LA Times was so careful in its phrasing, and why we must do the same. If you can't handle this and want a DRN, go for it. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[36mLionelt: The sources presented make a strong case for "substance abuse" or similiar. I agree with Belch's and 72Dino's well reasoned argument. – rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mStillStanding-247: WP:NPOV does not permit use to equate drug use with drug abuse. This is not negotiable. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
