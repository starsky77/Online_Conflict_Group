[31mYutsi: Haunted rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mYutsi: Can we remove the pseudoscience and extensive coverage of "haunted" areas in the subsections of Alcatraz_Cellhouse#Prison_life_and_the_cells? You can't verify that stuff, and the most that I think would be appropriate would be briefly stating that the penitentiary has a reputation for allegedly being haunted. ‚ù§   / ( ÂÅâÁâπ ) rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mDr. Blofeld: If you read it is says reported. I think its very relevant, the info is verifiable in multiple reliable sources, that's good enough for me.‚ô¶ rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34m99.137.48.242: There is nothing "reliable" about a Web site full of "ghost stories." Mythical, nonsensical tosh has no place in an encyclopedia, and anything beyond what Yutsi said goes ridiculously into the direction of WP:UNDUE. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mDr. Blofeld: No, you can't verify that something is haunted but you can verify something which is reputedly haunted; there are even whole books on the ghosts of Alcatraz. It is cited by numerous reliable sources as "reputedly haunted". We don't claim it to be haunted but are merely reporting what has been reported in multiple places elsewhere. To not mention anything of it is wrong given the coverage on it. Blocks A-C could use information about the time as a prison though.‚ô¶ rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36m140.182.57.175: I don't think you understand what a "personal attack" prohibited by WP:NPA is. Making comments about the veracity of claims is not a prohibited "personal attack" and I have not made comments about any contributors. ('''Comment on the content, not the contributor.''') I repeat, you have no right to repeatedly remove comments from a talk page. This article gives significant undue weight to nonsensical "paranormal" baloney that has zero serious scientific credibility. One brief mention is perhaps warranted of these pseudoscientific claims, but not endless repetition of ghost stories. Now let's stop the edit-warring and hash out what a (small) section on these claims should look like. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[36m140.182.57.175: For example, I am quite sure someone, somewhere has made claims about the White House having ghosts. There is not a ''single'' mention of "ghosts" or "haunting" on the White House Wikipedia page - for good reason, and that's because those claims have no place in an encyclopedia entry. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mDr. Blofeld: UNDUE? It barely mentions it. Always makes me laugh to see a newbie citing UNDUE and wiki guidelines, sock  puppet from Bloomington, Indiana!! Given the wealth of coverage with whole books dedicated to it I think this is perfectly acceptable to mention, although one could argue the alleged hauntings would be better but in a single paragraph at the bottom. Read Reportedly haunted locations in Washington, D.C..‚ô¶ rebuttal_labels:: DH0: Name calling/hostility, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[35mPolarscribe (usurped): That's an entirely separate article. The main White House article has no mentions of them. I would agree to splitting off all mentions in regards to this site into a separate article. Reportedly haunted locations in San Francisco has significant coverage already, and at best this subject deserves a single link in the main article. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[35mPolarscribe (usurped): Interesting, now who's making personal attacks, referring to the contributor and not the content? I am not a sock puppet, but I am plenty knowledgeable about Wikipedia, and under a former account, a retired administrator. But that has nothing to do with this particular dispute, and neither does my current location. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mDr. Blofeld: Reportedly haunted locations in San Francisco was written long after this was written. Retired administrator? Or banned administrator? I spent at least 10 hours of my time writing this article, heavily researching it and trying to write a good article which is valuable for wikipedia. I do not have time for arrogant professors who make snarky edit summaries belittling it. There are entire books existing on the ghosts of Alcatraz not to mention substantial coverage in multiple book sources. In fact I could probably write Reported hauntings of Alcatraz as a full article, in fact I think I'll do that tomorrow. The only point I can see is to put all mention of "psuedo science" into a bottom paragraph.‚ô¶ rebuttal_labels:: DH0: Name calling/hostility, DH3: Policing the discussion, DH4: Repeated argument
[35mPolarscribe (usurped): Wow. Seriously? You accuse me of personal attacks, and call me a "banned administrator" and an "arrogant professor"? More false, ridiculous personal attacks. I respect your efforts, but you do not own this article and I disagree with your focus. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Repeated argument
[32mDr. Blofeld: The only point I can see is to put all mention of "pseudo science" into a bottom paragraph. As an encyclopedia it is not our duty to be scientists and make judge judgements, we are here to report existing information which is very well documented in books and newspapers. It might be rubbish but multiple RS write about its hauntings so its good enough for me.‚ô¶ rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[35mPolarscribe (usurped): Wrong. We do not treat fringe viewpoints as equally worthy. The idea that any place can be "haunted" by "ghosts" is fringe. Again, see White House - not a single mention in that article. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[35mPolarscribe (usurped): If you don't want to work through consensus, I'll just have to GAR this thing. If you want to write 10 pages on ludicrous ghost story nonsense, be my guest, but it has virtually no place in the primary encyclopedia article about a federal penitentiary-turned-museum. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[35mPolarscribe (usurped): Furthermore, I demand that you retract your false personal attacks. Do you realize how ridiculous you sound, criticizing me for alleged personal attacks and then turning around and going ''ad hominem''? Seriously, it's hilarious. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[35mPolarscribe (usurped): I have created a separate section entitled "Paranormal claims" and linked it to the current article on reportedly-haunted locations in San Francisco, which contains all significant information on the matter. If you wish to create a separate article on the phenomenon, then that would be an appropriate link as well. rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mPolarscribe (usurped): I also added significantly to the "Reportedly haunted" article, from information that was removed from this article. rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mPolarscribe (usurped): Specifically, the issue here in WP:FRINGE is this: ''2. Generally considered pseudoscience: Theories which have a following, such as astrology, but which are generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community may properly contain that information and may be categorized as pseudoscience.'' Reports of "ghosts" or "hauntings" are generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community, and as per the Fringe theories guideline, should '''not''' be given significant prominence in an article. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[33mSchroCat: I have reverted the deleted entries. Perhaps you could discuss this here before you start edit warring over a few very minor points? Once you have a consensus to remove, that is the time to remove it, not before. -   ‚Ä¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[35mPolarscribe (usurped): That's quite simply wrong. You're reinserting fringe lunacy into an article where it has absolutely no place. There is not a single shred of scientific evidence that ghosts exist. Any claims to the contrary are fringe theories deserving of nothing more than a brief mention. Now I remember why I quit the first time. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[35mPolarscribe (usurped): Also, if you'd spend three minutes looking at something before you revert it, you'd realize that the citations you reverted go to the exact same document - the link I put in simply goes to an OFFICIAL copy of that document hosted on a U.S. Government Web site rather than a terrible white-on-black ad-filled version. The document in question is the [www.nps.gov/alca/photosmultimedia/upload/TheRock-web.pdf National Park Service Historical Resource Study] conducted by the NPS about Alcatraz Island. It is a highly reliable source and we should connect to the official version. rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mPolarscribe (usurped): You reinserted a link to a Web site entitled "Psychic Phone Readings" - http://www.pastlifetimes.net/psychic_phone_readings_ghost_story_alcatraz_ghosts.htm - that is, almost by definition, '''not''' a reliable source. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[33mSchroCat: You are allowing your own POV to cloud an issue. There are valid sources cited in this article and removing them based on your own POV and without getting a consensus is simply the wrong approach on Wiki. Furthermore, please do not edit war, try and remeber WP:BRD. The D is for "discuss", not "ignore what the sources tell me and hammer home my own POV regardless of others". -   ‚Ä¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH5: Counterargument
[35mPolarscribe (usurped): An article written by psychics is not a reliable source for any factual claim. That you don't understand that is mind-boggling. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[33mSchroCat: I have not said that particular source is reliable, so you can knock off the ''ad hominem'' comments. I reverted the deletions as a whole because you were edit warring over something that needs to be discussed '''first''', not fought over. -   ‚Ä¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[37mShearonink: Really?  there's no mentions of the ghost that Churchill saw or any of the other published sightings in the main article?  I'm  surprised that all the sightings by prominent people that have appeared in reliable sources aren't in the article or at the very least that there isn't "See also" linkage to Lincoln's Ghost and Reportedly haunted locations in Washington, D.C.#White House.  Thanks for mentioning it. rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[32mDr. Blofeld: @ Bloomington professor, you removed the content without at least trying to verify it in more reliable sources. We'd show you a lot more respect if you returned it and stopped your snotty nosed comments like " That you don't understand that is mind-boggling." We are both intelligent individuals and have contributed many FA quality articles to wikipedia, so why not start showing us a little respect eh? If you weren't so aggressive and presumptuous with your approach on this, treating us like dullards, you'd find you'd be more likely to get somewhere. Your tone of voice on this comes across as highly condescending, as if we know nothing and you know it all. Yes, it comes across as pure arrogance. If you don't want to be perceived in this way, I recommend you start treating others in the way you'd expect yourself to be treated. ‚ô¶ rebuttal_labels:: DH0: Name calling/hostility, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mDr. Blofeld: The idea that ghosts exist is fringe nonsense and 80 dozen references to it as if they are real do not belong in a historical article. Your views on ghosts itself is  gross POV. You dismiss it as nonsense, yet the purpose of life and indeed the idea that people are spiritual beings we can't possibly know. There are an awful lot of unexplained mysteries surrounding life and so many people have reported phenomena which they can't explain that one cannot arrogantly dismiss them as complete nonsense. I can't prove that people are not spiritual beings which may manifest after they've left their body anymore than I can't prove the existence of God and heaven and hell. Alcatraz, folklore, legend, maybe, its what ''thousands'' of people have reported and which hundreds of writers have written about so whether there are actually ghosts in Alcatraz or not it is not up to us to judge, but to report what has clearly been reported in masses of sources. No kidding, it would be like me editing the Islam article and removing any mention of Allah or the Christianity article removing any mention of God because I can't literally prove he exists; science doesn't recognize him so therefore its automatically nonsense? I doubt quite a few things in regards to religions but that's my opinion and my opinion only, I can't dispute the fact that multiple reliable sources document it and many people are convinced its true. It is not up to us as an encyclopedia to judge if the reports are fabricated or not, but to look at what reliable sources choose to write about which makes a topic noteworthy. It is a ''fact'' that Alcatraz is widely documented and claimed to be haunted. And you say my focus is on nonsense, when the amount mentioning paranormal activity amounted to just a few sentences and a relatively small section at the end of the article which seems appropriate. ‚ô¶ rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
