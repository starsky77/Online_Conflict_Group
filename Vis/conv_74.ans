[31mXfpisher: It's dead at the box office, and will struggle to reach 18mil domestic, on a Mid-30's budget (and yes, I have a source for that).  Overseas has been equally dismal so far.  Box Office Mojo called it a bomb, as did Deadline Hollywood.  The trades used slightly more polite language to say the same thing.  We can debate the language, but the meaning remains the samethis movie was a box office failure.  And how it was received at its red carpet opening in Florida, according to a puff piece in a local paper is really quite beside the point.  That entire section should be deleted.  It's not useful informationof course people said nice things about a movie that was shot in their area.  To devote so much space to such a minor event relating to a flop movie seems odd. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mArre 9: You are very ignorant in thinking a film that under-grossed is irrelevant and does not deserve available coverage on Wikipedia. The section is about "release"; premieres and stuff like that is apart of its release. This section is not only about its commercial performance. Also, roughly 90% of sources have reported the film's budget to be 30 million; so don't alter that. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mXfpisher: I was not remotely saying the film shouldn't be 'covered' on Wikipedia (where did you get that idea?), simply that the purpose of the article isn't to try and put lipstick on a pig.  The West Palm Beach opening was a nice gesture to the community, and means absolutely nothing, because people were reacting to the fact that they were getting some kind of gala event in their community (this isn't the rich part of Palm Beach, you understandthose people wouldn't have come at all).  I'm fine with having the event mentioned, and I'll leave in the part about the proceeds going to charity, but using this to try and make it seem like the film was well received, when it clearly was not, simply won't fly.  I don't know what you mean about '90% of sources', btw.  Can I see the other nine, please?  Obviously not all sources are created equal here, and when somebody who was involved in financing, producing, and releasing a movie says in Hollywood's paper of record that the budget was in the Mid-30 million dollar range, right around the time the picture comes out, that means it cost at least that much.  The Numbers was just estimating well in advance of release, and probably any other sources were just using their estimate.  It's outdated information, and I will change it as many times as I have to.  It's a flop movie either way, and this article will reflect that. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mStatus: I think it's ''too soon'' to classify the film as being anything. It's still yet to be released in the UK, Australia, France, etc. Â â€”Â Â , rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mXfpisher: Which is why I'm not dealing with the foreign box office yet.  But it's been pretty dismal so far, and there's little reason to think the few remaining major markets will change that.  EVERY box office observer of  note has called this movie a flop.  Having done this badly in North America (and really, every foreign market other than Russia, where it did respectable but unremarkable box office and is now quite finished), there's no way it can be perceived as anything other than a flop when all the money is counted.  That's why Box Office Mojo called it a bomb on the first weekendthere was no coming back from that opening, which is why calling it 'modest' is kind of understating the problem. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mXfpisher: Btw, have you actually SEEN this movie?  I note in passing that you are Australian, and it hasn't opened there yet.  I also note that your primary concern seems to be that Jennifer Lopez is in it.  Well, I'm not concerned with that at all.  Put her up for an Oscar, if you want to.  But a flop remains a flop.  Why don't you go edit the page for Gigli?  ) rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[36mErik: I concur that "modest" is an inappropriate term to use. The citation says, "Parker and Movie 43 had terrible debuts," and we should state that. To say "perform modestly" is misleading. I would also excise the Statham ranking; it is too low to be consequential to the article.   | rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mXfpisher: Erik, why don't you edit it?  I'd willingly cede the exact phrasing to you, and if you think the ranking should go, then by all means delete it.  I just wanted to make it clear how badly this movie didI mean, it's been in theaters a little over a month here, and it grossed about 15k yesterday in all of North America.  That's pretty damn bad.  It's hardly the biggest flop of all time, but it is one of the worst flops Statham has been in.  Not Lopez, to be sure, but I don't really think that's her fault.  It's not really the article's job to explain whose fault it is, but again, a flop is a flop is a flop.  And this is a flop. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mArre 9: You're obviously very vocal in your need to address this as a flop and pig. Ofcourse I've seen this film, I wrote the plot section. As stated by Status, it is too early to deem this a flop overall. No offense, but your edits aren't exactly going well with the flow of the article. That is why I'm trying to wait until the film has come out in all regions to finish off the release section. Then It can be addressed as a flop. I do work on Lopez articles, but her being in the film isn't why I haven't summed it up as a flop yet. Please don't be rude and have some patience! rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Repeated argument
[32mArre 9: Additionally, the film got mixed to negative reviews from film critics; however you say it was badly received.... if a movie was awful like Gigli, people would not clap even if it was filmed in their town. Stop reading in between the lines; the fact that the crowd were impressed with the movie means they had a positive reaction with it, although critics did not. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mXfpisher: Arre, we have enough information now.  You are disagreeing with two editors.  The movie is a bomb. If by some miracle it does huge box office in the few remaining major markets (and there's absolutely no reason to think it will), we can always edit again, but it's a bomb in North America as of right now, and will remain oneErik's phrasing is perfectit was and is viewed as a bomb heresince it's an American film, you can hardly say that doesn't matter.  I'm not saying foreign markets don't count, I don't think that at all, but it's already opened in most of those markets, and it did very poorly in all but one of them.  It's a bomb everywhere but Russia, and it was a very moderate performer there. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument

[31mXfpisher: Arre, when you call another editor 'ignorant' (when you can't prove a single thing he's said wrong), you really don't have any business talking about rudeness.  It's really not too early, and the current language (which is not mine) should stand.  In any event, this is an American movie, and a performance this bad in the domestic market makes it a bomb, even if it's a huge hit elsewhere, which thus far it hasn't been.  There's no reason to wait until it's opened in every last territory (last one is in April) to say what's obvious.  It's a bomb.  It's also a picture with a Mid-30's budget, and I'll change that as many times as I have to.  You did not, I notice, list any other of the '90%' of sources you mention.  The Numbers estimate was fine, but now we have something better, and that's what's going to be used. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH4: Repeated argument
[31mXfpisher: I'll leave the part about the reviews being mixed to negative as it standsthat's fine. But the stuff about the West Palm Beach opening is just too long, and the source is not terribly impressive.  It reeks of puffery.  I'll have to keep deleting that.  Accept the compromise. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mXfpisher: Xfpisher, I only referred to your thinking as ignorant. You kinda imply that because the film undeperforms at the US box office, it isn't notable. Telling me to go work on Gigli because all care about is Lopez (untrue) is a little blunt/rude. Also, maybe i used the wrong words. You are in a rush to classify this as a flop. Just wait till we have enough results. Regarding the West Palm Beach line, the source is perfectly fine and i condensed the sentence. All is says is ''the crowd reacted with positive feedback to the film''..is this too sentence too difficult to endure? Also, I have no time to give you a list of 90% of sources, you know very well I meant that as a rough point. Please accept the fact that 30m is the most widely reported figure. "mid 30s" could be anything in the 30s, basically. Just because there is something better, doesn't mean that has to override hundreds of other sources. I'm kindly asking you to consider what I've said. Also, have you failed to see the adjustments I've made? You have your bomb clarification and I have provided multiple sources for the 30m figure (could give you many many more, but I couldn't be bothered). Additionally, please note that films don't always mirror movies, they are just based around them. The valid source said Daniel Parmett. Also, I spoke nothing about altering the reviews (just telling you that reviews and the crowds reaction are two separate deals), so there is no compromise being made here, just your adamant thoughts about the budget being 35m..... rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH4: Repeated argument
[32mArre 9: For gods sake Xfpisher, have I once stated this film wasn't a bomb or flop? We know you love to use these words, but no need to keep ''repeating yourself''. It's already been clarified that it underperformed in the US. Once it's been out in all markets then we can have a general statement. Actually, you're the one disagreeing with two editors. You lack sources to prove your 35m figure, while we've got plenty for the 30m figure. I don't see why you are insistent on "~35 million". Final response. rebuttal_labels:: DH0: Name calling/hostility, DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mXfpisher: Again, I'm not the one who edited the box office information last, so take it up with Erik.  And again, Nick Meyer, a studio executive, is a better source than a very early estimate from a website which wouldn't have had insider information, and which was undoubtedly the source for all the other sources you cited.  Not blaming The Numbers, but they are known for always putting up an estimate, even if there's no reliable info to be had.  They came pretty close, but were still millions off.  Again, if the consensus is leave it blank until such time as there's an exact figure, fine.  But just know I'll be sending that article link to The Numbers and Box Office Mojo.  They LIKE getting valid information. ) rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mArre 9: Why do you keep going on about 'The Numbers'? they were just one of many sources which contained the 30m figure. I didn't even look into that source much. What you do in your own time (spitefully send links to organizations to prove your point on a Wikipedia article) is not relevant here - so please keep that to yourself. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Repeated argument
[31mXfpisher: The other sources you've put up are not real sources.  They are minor online articles that are quite certainly using The Numbers as a source.  And Arre, weren't you saying I was being too personal a short time back?  I could easily respond in kind, but it's not worth the aggro, to use your local slang.  ) rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mArre 9: they are. I could have put up many more, I just put up the first ones i could find. ''The Observer'', ''Las Vegas Sun'', E! Online, etc are perfect sources. It's so obvious here: you know I edited most of this article. You are determined to point out every little mistake. I mean look at your edit summaries. A lot of your adjustments are positive but no need to brag on about it. I made one simple typo and you go and on about it in the edit summary. Learn how to edit and contribute to discussions without viewing this as a game, in which you would always like you 'win'. Your attitude is blatantly obvious. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH3: Policing the discussion, DH4: Repeated argument
[31mXfpisher: Again, with the type of 'source' you're using, it's just an endless replication of junk information.  The Numbers SAYS they're just estimating, but when there's nothing else available, people working with a deadline use what they can find with a Google search.  Nick Meyer was directly involved with financing the movie, and has no reason to inflate the budget (rather the opposite, which means it could be more than he says).  But again, what's the problem here?  I'm not trying to edit it back to 35milleave it blank for now.  What's the harm?  Why do you need it to say 30mil, when it obviously was more than that?  I'm not the one hanging on here.  Of course you've made contributions, who said otherwise?  If by typo, you mean 'shocked' instead of 'shot' (which is what the linked source said, as I think you know by now) then why did you edit it back again the first time?  That's the only reason I went on about it, because it was irritating having to fix an obvious mistake TWICE.  At least you're accepting it's 'Parmitt', not 'Parmett'.  We're making progress here.  If you can accept the language about the crowd reaction in Palm Beach being deleted, and leave my latest edits alone, I'd be quite happy to let this go for now.  I'd think you would be too.  Peace, out. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mArre 9: The reason I edited it back is because all of your other edits were unnecessary. Please learn to work around things. Would you please stop saying the Numbers? It's very annoying...you're just going on and on about something that's already been clarified. No one cares. Goodbye ) the only progress we've made here is you not adding back your "assumptions" into the article (This is Wikpiedia, so obviously we are going to use to most widely reported figure [The sources didn't get this number from ''The Numbers'', ''The Numbers'' obviously got this figure from other sources] instead of something a user assumes just because it came from one source. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH-1: Bailing out

[32mArre 9: Fishy. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mXfpisher: Translationbecause I sent them information they judged to be good enough to put up a budget numberwhich they hadn't done before, since bomojo is always a lot more careful about that kind of thing than The Numbersyou don't want to use it as a source, even though obviously I can't EDIT the Parker entry on that website.  I emailed them.  They checked it out.  They put it up.  Faster than I thought they would (I emailed them day before yesterday), so maybe it wasn't even because of me.  Even if it was because I sent them the information, they still had to check it out, and obviously they considered that quote from Variety sufficient.  And your response to that is 'fishy'.  And yes it isbut the fishy smell is coming from you, Arre. Your quarrel isn't with me, but with the facts. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[32mArre 9: No need to explain Xfpisher, it's obvious what's happened here, and it certainly is peculiar. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mXfpisher: What's 'peculiar' about my finding an interview that gives us the best available information, and making that available to online sources, two of which have found it credible, and used it to determine an approximate budget for this movie?  Which again, is the best anybody can dono exact figure will ever be available, and this figure is obviously much closer to the mark than the previous one, which you wanted to keep up.  I truly believe you'd have accepted Box Office Mojo as a source if I hadn't honestly admitted that I'd given them the information that led to their putting up the numberI certainly could have handled some things better, but that could be said of you as well, so maybe we should forgive each other our trespasses and move on.  But that's neither here nor there with regards to the factsthere is no perfect source for movie budgets, so you go with the best sources you can find, and you certainly pay attention when people who devote themselves to documenting this kind of thing find a source credible enough to use.  Clear your head, count to 10, do the right thing.  (editing this in) I just got an email from Bruce Nash, who runs The Numbershe thanked me for sending him the source, and he's already updated his databasehe says the updated budget number (with article citation) will appear on the website in the near future.  So that's Box Office Mojo, The Internet Movie Database, AND The Numbers saying 35mil.  And I'm still not editing it.  Honestly, I'm not sure what difference it makes at this point.  Just thought you'd want to know. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
