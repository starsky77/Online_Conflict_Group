[31mCerejota: It relies largely or entirely upon a single source. - Not only is a single source in use, Richard Felix Staar, "Foreign policies of the Soviet Union", but this is a partisan book, published by a partisan institution.
Its neutrality is disputed. - Crealy based on a single, partisan source, makes it non-neutral. Furthermore, the list of organizations included here is unsourced and seem more like attempts to smear rather than an encyclopedic survey.
Its factual accuracy is disputed. - The term is an epithet used by political rivals, and its instances a documented phenomenon by neutral researchers are lacking. It should be trivial to find sources backing this.
It may contain previously unpublished synthesis of published material that conveys ideas not attributable to the original sources. - Since the article seems to be written in the perspective that one definition of the term, in a single source, is correct,
Its neutrality or factuality may be compromised by weasel words. - The lack of generalized neutrality is further exacerbated by the use of terms like "totalitarian" or " transmogrified" in ways that break NPOV presentation.
Its introduction provides insufficient context for those unfamiliar with the subject - The term is an epithet envogue during the McCarthy era, and while some organizations were indeed organizations controlled by communist parties, many organizations that were not communist controlled, or even were anti-communist were called by this label, both by mainstream and fringe sources. Howeve rit is presented to the reader as a technical term, rather than a political epithet born out of an specific context.
The examples and perspective in this article may not include all significant viewpoints.
This article needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding reliable references. - Needs not only to expand the source used, but provide a wide range of views on the subject, from different view points. This is a controversial term, and needs to be treated as such. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mCerejota: I would agree to a redirect and merge to a relevant article, such as McCarthyism or some such, but it is clear this term, if deleted and not salted, will bounce back into existence (as it is indeed a notable term) and I would rather ensure it is a quality contribution than have it be recreated by a partisan and having to AfD again. Another possibility is to move to Communist front (epithet) but there is no reason to disamb, so ther ecould be a good-faith effort not to that. That said, I wouldn't oppose an AfD and !v delete as it stands, because beyond notability there is precious little here to salvage as an encyclopedia article. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mRjensen: Communist front is a standard term in the RS and the scholarly literature, and the problems that Cerejota complains about have been largely fixed. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mCerejota: Communist front is a controversial term used by partisans to discredit organizations that might or might not have relationships with communist organizations. Its use in literature is not an acceptance of a validity of the term, but a study of its use.
Article issues largely remain, thinga like "totalitarian Marxist" are extreme violations of NPOV, the article largely follows one view on this concept etc etc etc. Even the addition of sources have not diminish the reliance in a single source for structure and argument. Notably, criticism of the use of the term is largely absent. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mRjensen: Carejota seems to believe the Stalinists were not totalitarian or perhaps not Marxist or somethinghe's very vague as to what his problem might be. Does he think the Communist front organizations did not exist, or perhaps they should be called something else? rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[36mBobfrombrockley: I agree with Certoja that this is a far from perfect article, but it is not as bad as porrayed and certainly not worthy of deletion. Other sources are used in the article, e.g. Lynn Mally, "Inside a Communist Front: A Post-Cold War Analysis of the New Theatre League," American Communist History, June 2007, Vol. 6 Issue 1, pp 65-95. Others should and could easily be added, and most of the problems could be corrected. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mCerejota: Cerejota is the name. What you or I believe about this topic is entirely irrelevant. What is relevant is that the use of the term "totalitarian" in relationship with any political movement is an expression of a partisan point of view and hence violates the principle of WP:NPOV. The non-existence of sources and points of views that refute this analysis is a violation of NPOV as per WP:UNDUE. Those things, unlike our opinions, do matter. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mCerejota: I have not argued for deletion, and explicitly said so in this very talk page. Since I do not have access to these sources, my only recourse is tagging. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument

[32mSoman: I'd say my problems with this article is mainly with the delimitation and tone. If are going to have an article on mass organizations, then the text would need some serious re-working. The notion of 'fronts', with the conspirationalist (not sure that's a proper English word, but can't find a better at the moment, is tilted and highly paternalistic. It tries to assume that anyone associated with the communist movement would be duped by alien agents, it seeks to negate the possibility that people would embrace Marxism by their own free will. If we take an approach to communist mass work more globally (outside the scope of 1950s USA), we find that in most cases members and sympathizers of pro-communist mass organizations are: 1) well aware of the partisan links of the organization and 2) has sympathy towards the party organization.
Mass organizations should be understood in the following context: A Communist Party is, per definition, a vanguard party. To be a member of the party, you have to have a certain level of ideological formation and be willing to commit time and effort to party work. Many people, who might be sympathizers of the party, are not able/willing to assume this task. Thus the party creates mass organizations, usually along sectors (youth, students, trade unions, women, peasants, cultural associations, etc.), to which membership is open for anyone willing to join. The maximum programme of the mass organization coincides with minimum programme of the party.
That said, mass organizations are not a uniquely communist phenomenon. Could we find any source, that is not a Cold War diatribe, that actually explores this subject? The present listing has little encyclopediatic value. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mRjensen: the opening lede quotes Schrecker: "Schrecker says that on the contrary, "most of these people knowingly collaborated with the party, believing it to be the most effective ally they could find."  Of course it's not a matter of timeit was a matter of control.  The Party exerted very firm control over its members and that intense intrusive control was hard for many to accept.  The demand for "Passionate Commitments" is very well made in Gerald Zahavi, "Passionate Commitments: Race, Sex, and Communism at Schenectady General Electric, 1932-1954," ''Journal of American History,'' Sep 1996, Vol. 83 Issue 2, pp 514-548 in JSTOR In a nutshell, you have to love the Stasi-like surveillance to remain a party member, and at the least sign of deviation you were expelled. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mCerejota: Please read WP:LEDE. I have removed non-compliant material. Also I am begining to see a WP:QUOTEFARM tendency, The article is about the term "communist front", not its usage or examples of people using it. This goes hand in hand with WP:OR and WP:SYNTH: we must use sources to support statements made in the encyclopedic voice that are a result of the source's research. Examples of simple usage, without counter-examples are unacceptable. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mCerejota: I have opened a merger discussion because I tried to edit this article to a neutral state, and came up with very little that doesn't overlap with it. So a merger would both keep the term, and a section in that article, subject to WP:UNDUE limits. rebuttal_labels:: 
[35mCarrite: Mass organization redirects to "Communist party," which is epically dumb. "Communist front" and "Mass organization" are close to the same meaning, one being a right wing pejorative and the other a left wing self-description. There is a flavor of difference beyond that, an element of ''intended deception.'' Some CP mass organizations were comparatively open in terms of their association to the relevant Communist Party; others were not. Both terms should point to the same article, which will be a tough one to write with balance. It is absolutely beyond question, to my mind, that the article title should be "Mass organization" rather than "Communist front" on the basis of NPOV. The latter absolutely has a pejorative context, while the former is a self-description. This seems a pretty easy call. There's a comment above that "Communist front" is a term that is used in the literature. That's true. So is "Mass organization" (I was working from a book on the early CP of Vietnam this morning published in 1982 by Cornell University Press that used the term, for example). It will be a writing challenge getting things written neutrally, but there are battleground articles all over the place at WP and this doesn't seem like anywhere near the biggest. Reason needs to prevail. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mCarrite: With regard to the inanity of the redirect of "Mass organization" to "Communist party" — the '''whole point''' of Mass organizations/Communist fronts was that they were NOT the party and burdened by the discipline of the party. They were intended as a mechanism to build broader participation ''outside the party'' to advance policy objectives of the Communist Party, and secondarily to help the party identify and attract motivated and sympathetic people to its cause. It's a subject for an article in and of itself, completely separate from an article discussing "Communist party." rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[35mCarrite: I've been parsing the history of the "Communist Party" page. It seems that Soman inadvertently hijacked the article back in Dec. 2006 when he ported over some of the "CP" material to History of Communism, adding material on Mass Organizations in its stead. The article has been the subject of innumerable edits and much conflict since, but it's more or less the same piece. i think it needs to be blown back into some approximation of its early 2006 state, which wasn't all bad, and the "Mass organization" material combined with "Communist front" material as a new "Mass organization" page. My view anyway. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mBobfrombrockley: I've left my view at the Communist party talkpage, but wanted to add that if this article remains it needs to remove the US stuff from the lede and have a global lede and the US stuff in the US section. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mBobfrombrockley: I've been looking more at the article, and done some edits to try to start to address some of these issues. I think this will make the basis of a better article if it stays here, or make the material stronger if it is merged elsewhere. Obvl  iously still needs more work. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mRjensen: Merger = bad idea. The issue of Communist fronts has a large literature quite apart from the large literature on the Communist party. That is, the RS do not merge the topics and so Wikipedia should not do so.  A merger assumes that all Communists fronts are somehow part of the CPbut that was not true. Often a handful of Communists quietly took over an organization at the top. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mSoman: No. If you write a lede for 'Jewish Bolshevism', basing 85% on quotes from Goebbels and Gestapo archives and then add 'the scholar X disagrees with this' in the end, then you're still not acheiving NPOV. In fact the negation of Schrecker only pushes the POV synth further, as it projects the McCarthyist as the mainstream view and the less conspiracy-theorist view as the dissident. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
