[31mMiradre: Factual inaccuracy rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMiradre: Slrubenstein, why are you restoring factually incorrect claims? You can read the original source yourself here and see tht the claim is incorrect. That the claim is the first is not mentioned, or that the author was unaware of modern genetics, or that the observation was based on animal husbandry.

[32mSlrubenstein: I have no idea what you are talking about. The claim is mentiond, it is the earliest published example, and your suggestion that the author was aware of modern genetics is so laughable I suggest you wait until you finish high school before trying to write encyclopedia articles.    | rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH0: Name calling/hostility

[34mMaunus: Miradre is right that you cannot source a claim about a book being the first to mention something to the book itself. The question of whether he was aware of modern genetics also needs to be sourced to a reliable source. All in all the article is in a dire need of good secondary sources. The claim about the theory having achived wider support is for example also cited only to partisan primary sources - how about someone actually looked for some secondary or tertiary sources to back up their claims here?Â· rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument

[32mSlrubenstein: It won't be hard to add a secondary source that he was the first scholar to propose this, or at least the first contemporary scholar.  That he was not aware of modern genetics is something we just need to add I would argue in order to have a readible encyclopedia article; given his argument that inbreeding produces congenital defects, the imaginary average 21st century reader might well think that he believed this because of genetic research; it only makes sense to clarify that this was not the case.  I do not see this as original research or synth, I see it as proper contextualization. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mSlrubenstein: But Maunus, if you want to add these additional sources, by all means - I agree you would be improving the article.    | rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mMaunus: I don't see how someone writing 150 years ago is more contemporary than those writing immediately before him (e.g. Morgan and McLennan and E. B. Tylor who coined the phrase "Marry out or die out")... Adding the bit about genetics is begging the question and tacit WP:SYNTH if it is not supported by a source.  I am not going to add those sources - but I suggest both you and Miradre look them over instead of edit warring and namecalling.Â· rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[32mSlrubenstein: Where did I claim that Maine was more contemporary than Morgan or McLennan?    | rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mMiradre: The text you are restoring is claiming that Maine was the first despite that he himself states otherwise in the source. '' Miradre''  E-mail) rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mSlrubenstein: Maine does not claim that Morgan or Mclellan were explaining exogamy based on the deleterious biological consequences of inbreeding.  What specifically are you referring to?  I've read it, I do not see any place where he is attributing this explanation to Morgan or McLennan. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mSlrubenstein: If you have any source that claims that Morgan or Mclennan or anyone else made this claim before Maine, by all means add that view and provide a citation, but Maine himself did not say this.  Maunus provided links to recent secondary sources - if any of them attributes this claim to someone other than Maine, I would be all for adding it into the article.    | rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mMiradre: Page 226, "On the other hand, Morgan... ...He supposes that primitive man very early discovered the evils of close inbreeding and that all the early transformations of human society were the result of a constant struggle to prevent these evils". '' Miradre''  E-mail) rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mMiradre: Furthermore, the text still makes the claim that Maine developed this based on observing "animal husbandry" which is not in the source. Also, more generally, primary sources are of course not suited for statements like "first instance of a theory". Claiming that is OR.'' Miradre''  E-mail) rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mSlrubenstein: I appreciate your providing a specific quote, maybe this can help us clear things up.  But the evils of inbreeding are not the same thing as congenital birth defects.  Lewis Henry Morgan no doubt viewed incest as a sin, and argued that there was a drive within culture to evolve to higher forms.  Evil is a moral claim and if Maine or Morgan meant something more, you will need to provide a quote that says so.  maunus provided links to several secondary sources, can you find a quote in any of them?  In the quote you provide, Maine is not saying that Morgan's explanation for the incest taboo was congenital birth defects.  Maine is not saying that this was Morgan's explanation.
Also, Maine does talk about animal husbandry and on the very page cited.    | rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mMiradre: Congential birth defects are of course never explicitly mentioned by Maine either. "Selected the wild forms of certain animals for domestication" is of course not the same as making observations of congenital birth defects in "animal husbandry". Finally, again, primary sources are not suited for discovering who was the first since this is OR based on them. '' Miradre''  E-mail) rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mSlrubenstein: Selected the wild forms of certain animals for domestication is of course precisely what "animal husbandry" means. "I cannot see why the men who selected the wild forms of certain animals for domestication should not find out that children of unsound constitution were born of nearly related parents ... " â€” it is precisely providing this explanation for exogamy that Maine says is his contribution. But I promise you I will add a secondary surce tomorrow.  In the mantime by all means do add your secondary sources on Maine, Morgan etc.    | rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mMiradre: You restored the material, you have the burden of evidence. See WP:BURDEN. Also, you made an incorrect citation. A correct one is "I cannot see why men who discovered the use of fire and selected the wild forms of certain animals for domestication and of vegetables for cultivation..." Thus, he is talking about general human cleverness. Not observation of congenital birth defects in "animal husbandry". '' Miradre''  E-mail) rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mMaunus: When motivating the prohibition of incest 'biologically', one generally thinks of the danger connected with the increased probability of homozygosity in incest, namely the manifestation of harmful recessive characters. The main supporters of this argument were Morgan (1877), Maine (1883), and Westermarck (1889). (Bischof 1975 Comparrative Ethnology of Incest Avoidance in Robert Fox (ed.)Biosocial Anthropology )Â· rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mMaunus: Another theory, championed generations ago by Lewis H. Morgan and others, and not without defenders today, is that incest was defined and prohibited because inbreeding causes biological degeneration.4 This theory is so plausible as to seem self-evident, but it is wrong for all that. In the first place, inbreeding as such does not cause degeneration; the testimony of biologists is conclusive on this point. To be sure, inbreeding intensifies the inheritance of traits, good or bad. (The Definition and Prohibition of Incest. Leslie A. White. American Anthropologist , New Series, Vol. 50, No. 3, Part 1 (Jul. - Sep., 1948), pp. 416-435 )Â· rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mMiradre: Just a comment regarding the last claim. Sure, it is possible to construct a theoretical population where inbreeding causing increased frequency of homozygosity is not a harmful like a population without recessive genetic diseases. In the real world recessive diseases exist and inbreeding increases mortality in humans. There are also other dangers beside increased pure homozygosity like that a small gene pool of Major histocompatibility complex variants in a population increases the risk of resistant diseases. These are important argument that Slrubenstein constantly have deleted, apparently because they do not fit his the-incest-taboo-is-just-a-social construction view.

[32mSlrubenstein: Well, let us add these properly contextualized to the article.    | rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mSlrubenstein: No, I never deleteed this from the article, I have simply put it in its place,  This is not an articles about inbreeding and its consequences, which is all Mirardre seems to obess on.  This is not even an article on incest, which can involve inbreeding but often times does not, but anyway is the objct of another article,  This is an article on "the incest taboo" which is social fact found in many societies but not all.  The United States and the UK arguably od not have an incest taboo.  Instead, it is regulated by the state through laws, which are not the same things as taboos.  You seem to be demanding to turn the article into what it is not.    | rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mMiradre: Since the secondary sources Maunus have kindly presented have established that if anyone should be mentioned it is Morgan, I hope we can remove the material about Maine from the article. Sure, how wide the incest taboo applies varies culturally but there is a view that there is hard biological core that is not only due to culture but is genetically programmed. This view should be presented fairly including the evidence supporting this. Besides what I have already mentioned it also includes the presence of incest avoidance in many animals including our closest primate relatives.

[34mMaunus: I now have a copy of Wolf and Durham's "Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo the state of knowledge at the turn of the century". This book basically presents the bio-centric viewpoint and presents rather strong arguments in favor of seeing the Westermarck effect as a real and evolved mechanism for incest avoidance. Its main doubt however is still the question of whether this means that the Incest Taboo has a biological underpinning - one author (Durham, the odd one out in this context, but probably more representative of the cultural anthropological viewpoint) argues that the reality of the Westermarck effect in fact undermines the argument that the taboo is biological, because in the cases where the effect have been shown (kibbutz children, taiwanese and lebanese adopted brides) there has actually been a rule dictating marriage between children that have grown up together - i.e. the effect did not result in any cultural tendency to condemn such unions. That is, there is no evidence from the jump from biological mechanism to cultural rule.Â· rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mMiradre: That is an interesting view that should be presented in the article. '' Miradre''  E-mail) rebuttal_labels::
