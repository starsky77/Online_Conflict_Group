[31mLovok Sovok: Please explain repeated removal of a referenced section. "Communist propaganda" is just as bad argument as if I would say that this whole article is one big "underkilled Banderovtsi propaganda". The question is whether there facts are true or false. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mVolunteer Marek: Actually the question is not whether these "facts" are true or false but whether the info is verifiable with secondary reliable sources. It's gonna take me awhile to read it but even a cursory glance suggests that these are in fact primary sources. What would be needed is secondary sources which discuss these documents and based on them state what the text being inserted claims. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mLvivske: This just reeks of the Jo0doe tactic of using non-English primary sources to push garbage into articles. If the Party was providing aid, I'm sure there's a historian out there that can mention it, we don't need to rely on 1st hand interpretations of primary sources. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[36mFifelfoo m: Primary sources are not acceptable as verification in historical articles. Only professional historians are capable of reading archival sources to produce original research. Wikipedia is neither a historian or a site for the promulgation of original research. Good removal. _ rebuttal_labels::

Or at least  - ''this led on February 25, 1933, to a seed loan from Union stockpiles of 20,300,000 poods of grain to Ukraine and another 15,300,000 poods to the North Caucasus Territory, specifically to the Kuban.''

The claims still foolish - On August 7, 1932 a law came into force that stipulated that '''all food was state property''' and that '''mere possession of food was evidence of a crime. -'''  Name of Law pls- it's unknown to the world
'November 1932 Ukraine was required to provide 1/3 of the grain collection of the entire Soviet Union -???'' 18.5/3 = 6.1 millions!!! Only in November 1932??? Why  4.3 millions listed for whole 1932 harvest (D&W; 2010 tables section ) ???
