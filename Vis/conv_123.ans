[31mAprock: The new section '''Ethnic heterogenity''', appears to be based on primary sources.  Please help improve the section by locating independent secondary sources which establish the weight of views expressed in the primary sources. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mAcadƒìmica OrientƒÅlis: The source is a literature review and not a primary source. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mAprock: The content you added just cites primary sources through the review.  In fact, the actual synthesis of the review is ignored in the content you added: ''However, our main conclusion from this survey is that most studies do not point to a quantitatively important role for ethnic diversity in shaping natives‚Äô preferences for redistribution. In most studies, the association is much weaker than for other factors such as own income (current or expected) or beliefs about the role of effort versus luck in determining this income.  Moreover, it seems that the sizeable negative association between ethnic diversity and support for redistribution that is sometimes found in U.S. studies does not generalize to Canada or Europe. However, the evidence for countries other than the U.S. is scarce so far, and there is certainly need for further research.''.  Based on this, it appears that the section has significant POV issues. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mAcadƒìmica OrientƒÅlis: All reviews cites primary sources so that is not a reason for exclusion. I have mentioned that the effect is weak. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mAprock: Picking and choosing which of the reviewed primary sources to highlight is WP:SYNTHESIS.  Ignoring the actual conclusion (most studies do not point to a quantitatively important role for ethnic diversity) to instead promote your own interpretation (statistically significant but relatively weak negative relationship) is a perfect example of POV editing. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mAcadƒìmica OrientƒÅlis: The introductory statement also states that the effect is sometimes quite strong in the US which I have not mentioned. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mAcadƒìmica OrientƒÅlis: Do you have an alternative formulation? We could quote the actual text if you prefer. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mAprock: Probably the best way to approach a technical review would be to use the '''Non-technical summary''' on page three as a basis for the content: rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mAcadƒìmica OrientƒÅlis: Sure, as a basis, but it is not particularly clear in places like how individual attitudes and behavior are affected. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mAprock: If those details are not mentioned in the lay summary, they don't need to be in wikipedia. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mAcadƒìmica OrientƒÅlis: No such rule. If something is unclear it should be clarified. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mAprock: When you pick and choose what parts of a source to include, and what parts to exclude, that is synthesis.  Using generally accepted summary sections of a source as a basis for content is the straightforward way to approach the issue.  Comparing the content that you inserted with the lay summary above, there is a clear disconnect indicating POV issues with what you added.  Instead of advocating for highlighting whatever portions of the review that you are most interested in promoting, I suggest you start from scratch with the lay summary. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mAcadƒìmica OrientƒÅlis: Using your argumentation everything except a complete quote of the whole paper or the whole summary is a synthesis. There is no policy that states that only certain portions of a study are allowed. A summary should be a basis but if it is unclear this should be fixed. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH4: Repeated argument
