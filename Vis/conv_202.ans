[31mVoiceOfreason: OBE (Order of the British Empire) citation missing rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mVoiceOfreason: I cannot find any evidence (after searching many sites) of him ever being awarded this. That being the case I am removing any reference to it until someone can provide such.voiceofreason   ‚Äî¬†Preceding unsigned comment added by   ‚Ä¢ rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mVoiceOfreason: Quoting an uncited article from "Fox news latino" hardly qualifies as proof of him receiving the OBE. I will remove that reference and await an actual source.voiceofreason   ‚Äî¬†Preceding unsigned comment added by   ‚Ä¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mWinkelvi: It's referenced by a reliable source.  Please see WP:VERIFY.  The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability over truth.  Keep removing it, , and you will end up getting reported for edit warring.  Your choice.   ‚óè rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mBob Caldwell CSL: I am in partial agreement with  regarding sources for things like the OBE. Stories that appear in much of the news media within the first couple of days after an event like this are forced to rely on information that has not yet had time to be properly researched. Sometime, their information comes (uncredited) from other news agencies so they all end up saying the same thing, true or not. If the first news source got the OBE information from Munroe's web-site or even from Wikipedia (irony of ironies), then everyone will report it, since it's not a critical fact. So, I think it is wise to be slow to put these things into a page. That said, I do like the most recent source cited. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mWinkelvi: I searched specifically for a UK source.  In fact, that particular source publishes recipients of the OBE year-to-year.  It's already a reliable source (Fox News Latino is a reliable source as well, most certainly).  It's coming from two reliable sources - one in the UK - and we have no way of knowing where they go their information.  To think they got what they've written from Wikipedia is using pure speculation and probably falls under WP:CRYSTAL to some degree.  That said, if it's reported in a reliable source, then it's valid for inclusion.  I see no reason to remove the OBE content in the article considering the fact that we now have two reliable sources supporting the inclusion of it.   ‚óè rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mVoiceOfreason: I found lists of recipients on several websites but no reference of this man on any of them so I have to conclude that the original mentions of him on the news sites (hardly authorities in and of themselves) were likely pulled from Wikipedia. Yes, quite ironic. Calling a main stream media outlet (of any color) a "reference" is quite the stretch in my mind.voiceofreason ‚Äî¬†Preceding unsigned comment added by   ‚Ä¢ rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mWinkelvi: , please familiarize yourself with what is considered a reliable source in Wikipedia and what is not.  While you, as an individual, can make conclusions on where sources get their information, putting your conclusions into article content is WP:CRYSTAL and WP:SYNTH, equating original research.  None of which is allowable in the course of editing Wikipedia.   ‚óè rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mVoiceOfreason: Here is the list of recipients in 1998 and his name is not one of them so let's put it to bed that he did not receive it: http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/queens-birthday-honours-1998-1164586.htmlvoiceofreason rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mWinkelvi: You're trying to prove a negative with an online newspaper?  I hardly think an online publication is the definitive source for those receiving any honors.  We'd need something more reputable and infallible to prove he was NOT given the OBE in 1998 (or any year, for that matter).   ‚óè rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
