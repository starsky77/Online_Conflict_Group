[31mBali88: Molestation allegations rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mBali88: You can't just omit any reference to the molestation allegations. For one thing, people know they were alleged and people believe there is evidence based on rumors they've heard. Explaining the nature of the allegations, how it played out in court, and ''why'' the allegations were rejected by the supreme court is important to help those people understand the nature of these things. Without that section, people will continue to believe that there actually is credible evidence. Those allegations are an integral part of this case and its important for the audience to understand how this all played out and the prosecutorial misconduct that went into it. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mOveragainst: You can't just omit any reference to the molestation allegations. I did no such thing in my edit. The allegation that Carr had molested his 5 year old daughter was mentioned thrice in my edit. As you can see here, it's in the lede (mentioned in the full proper context of the  second conviction being overturned because the prosecution told the jury Carr molested his daughter Jill  their opening statement but brought forward no evidence to support their accusation. Then the molestation is mentioned in the second trial section, and finally in the prosecutorial misconduct section.
Currently there is a Molestation allegations section that  begins '''"The molestation allegations remain controversial and there is little consensus as to the cause of Jill's injuries"''' and ends '''"The nature and the cause of Jill's injuries remain a mystery, as well does the time frame in which they happened. Camm denies ever abusing his daughter and has never been charged with any molestation-related offense.[69]"''' Not our job to discuss evidence in that way. Even if he was not a living person, WP:ALIVE, that phasing is weight and not NPOV. You cannot discuss such an accusation in the way the current section is doing with a whole section, about a living person, and then end by saying 'it's a mystery, he denies it and hasn't been charged with it.' rebuttal_labels:: DH7: Refuting the central point
[31mBali88: Also, what evidence feels non-notable to you? I left out the vast majority of the evidence and I feel like the evidence included was pretty crucial to the case. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mBali88: So you feel like it's not neutral the way it's written? I feel like this is the current status of things. There was nothing linking it to Camm, but the supreme court didn't rule that it wasn't a sexual assault and Boney's DNA is on Jill's clothing above the area. What wording specifically feels biased to you? rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mOveragainst: Please indent your comments.  I have already given my reasons and supplied quotes in bold of the beginning and end of the section, which I think is showing an unacceptable tone and content throughout, especially for a allegation of this type about a living person. You saying  "There was nothing linking it to Camm, but the supreme court didn't rule that it wasn't a sexual assault"  is an odd way to look at it and not in line with my understanding of BLP policy. I think you need much better reasons, and support from some cited WP guidance on BLPs for the article remaining as it is. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mBali88: you're going to have to be clearer on how exactly this violates BLP. I see nothing contentious about the section whatsoever. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mOveragainst: Please cite where WP:ALIVE in yor opinion says you can use the kind of language I bolded above. I see that John from Idegon, Arthur goes shopping and others have tried to explain the problems with the page, to little avail. I'll give you time to think over what I have been saying, and re read  what others have been saying. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
