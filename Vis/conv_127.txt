Even more misleading, there is the widespread, popular belief that this expulsion created the diaspora." ♥Although the myth of an exile from the Jewish homeland (Palestine) does exist in popular Israeli culture, it is negligible in serious Jewish historical discussions.(Israel Bartal, dean of humanities at the Hebrew University)', 'username': 'Dailycare', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH7: Refuting the central point'], 'coordination_labels': []}

Regarding the Jews that did live in Judea at the time, many were slaughtered during the wars with Rome, in fact, most of them as Cassius Dio wrote after the Bar Kokhva revolt and as shown by archeology and other testimonies. Many were taken as slaves (around 100,000 according to Josephus) during the first war; Many of the remaining Jews left after, because of the ongoing persecutions, special taxes, land grabbing etc...', 'username': 'Benjil', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH6: Refutation'], 'coordination_labels': []}
