[31mErik den yngre: Denmark, Norway and Sweden have during the last 10-15 years amended their constitutions such that Lutheran churches are now separated from the state, after 500 years of unity. Lutheranism is no longer the public religion and the church is no longer a branch of the government. â€” '''' rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mWtmitchell: The details are a bit more complicated than that (e.g., Article 4 in Part i of the Danish constitution does say, "The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, and, as such, it shall be supported by the State.", with some detail about that added in Part VII there), and the question is how much of that detail ought to be covered in this article. Perhaps a note something like  ''See also: Constitution of Denmark'' ought to be added to the info on Denmark in this article and similar notes and wikilinks to Constitution of Sweden and the Constitution of Norway articles for the other countries. Also, re "10-15 years", see WP:DATED.    (earlier ''Boracay Bill'') rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mErik den yngre: Article 16 in Norway's constitution: "Den norske kirke, en evangelisk-luthersk kirke, forblir Norges folkekirke og understÃ¸ttes som sÃ¥dan av staten. ... Alle tros- og livssynssamfunn skal understÃ¸ttes pÃ¥ lik linje." Translated: "The church of Norway, an evangelical-lutheran church, remains the people's church and is as such supported by the state. ... All religions shall be supported on equal terms." Lutheranism was from 1536 to 2012 the public religion in Norway. This is no longer the case. Priests are no longer civil servants. This is in fact a small revolution that the church is separated from the government, it has been a long and (for some) a painful process. While the church of Norway by tradition and size has a special status is clear, but in Norway it is widely agreed that there is no more a state religion in the country. â€” '''' rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mWtmitchell: The lead sentence of this article defines the term ''State religion'' for purposes of this article. That definition currently reads:
As I read your translation of Article 16 of Norway's constitution above and the translation here, which reads:
the Church of Norway falls within this article's definition of the term ''State religion'' in Norway.    (earlier ''Boracay Bill'') rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mErik den yngre: Yes, this a bit odd. One translation uses "established church" (a concept that does not make any sense in Norwegian), while the original actually says "people's church" ("folkekirke", "folk" means "people" or "popular"). The lead of the present article is quite vague "officially endorsed by the state". In Norway, Sweden and Denmark the previous state churches have gone through a process of disestablishment. The church and the state was one for 500 years, now the separation is definite. It is puzzling to see that these profound changes are not reflected in the article. The term "folkekirke" ("people's church") is intentionally vague and was added as a political compromise to satisfy the traditionalists and the christian party, it does not have any practical significance. The original 1814 constitution stated "Den evangelisk-lutherske Religion forbliver Statens offentlige Religion." ("Lutheranism is the public religion of the state"), jews, jesuits and monks were at the same time banned from the land. The ban on jews and monks was removed after some years, then in 2012 the words "public religion" was finally removed from the constitution. There is no more a public (or state) religion in Norway. â€” '''' rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mErik den yngre: The church itself said in 2012: Den norske kirke kan derfor ikke lenger betegnes Â«statskirkenÂ». ("The church of Norway can no longer be labeled the 'state church'.") â€” '''' rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mWtmitchell: This article currently has an empty ''Notes'' section. I suggest that for countries where the simplistic definition of ''State religion'' in the lead sentence of the article isn't up to a complex situation such as this, those countries be classified according to whatever the situation is, with an explanatory footnote being placed in the ''Notes'' section using the  and  templates.

[31mErik den yngre: Thanks. That is a good idea. The GjÃ¸nnes-commission of 2006 (also known as the State/Church commission) pointed out that there is not one single aspect that defines "state church", but several aspects that jointly characterizes a situation with state church, including
If there is public religion
If clergy is appointed by the government
If doctrine is matter for the government
If the church is governed by state legislation
If the church is publicly funded
If the church is an independent legal entity ("incorporated") or branch of the government apparatus
In Norway, only # 5 remains, and to some degree # 4, but # 4 will change as a consequence of # 6. â€” '''' rebuttal_labels::
