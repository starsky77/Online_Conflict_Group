{'text': 'I have added the neutrality dispute tag, because it looks like there are editors who systematically remove all criticism. This is unacceptable under WP:NPOV. The most recent edit of this sort is this one, where well-sourced criticism is deleted without explanation. I see from reading earlier posts on this talk page that there was at one time a "criticism" section of the article, which has evidently been deleted. The Dalai Lama\'s contact with the Nazis is mentioned in this context, but it appears nowhere in the article.

As far as I can see, these items were removed strictly for POV reasons, which is the basis for my assertion that the article is not neutral.
