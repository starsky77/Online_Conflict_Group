But if you follow the internal wiki link for say English Football Hall of Fame or, PFA Players' Player of the Year you will find Kenny Dalglish at the years provided.\nOf course If I can find additional external source links then I'll include them as it increases the credibility with more references, but you don't have to remove the current internal link I put there as they are valid, you can check them all.\nLook at Alex Ferguson, Bill Shankly, even good rated articles like Lionel Messi. Many of the individual awards are not externally sourced.\nLike I said I can add external source references where I find them but it's not defamatory or controversial like you said, and doesn't warrant removal.  —\xa0Preceding unsigned comment added by   •", 'username': 'Shreerajtheauthor', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
