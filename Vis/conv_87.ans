[31mDeicas: Endorsement of the potential issuance of a trillion dollar coin rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mDeicas: , in revision en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Krugman&oldid;=532290410, removed my addition of Dr. Krugman's endorsement of the potential issuance of a  trillion dollar platinum coin giving, as a reason "oh for chrissake, he is too joking. He's using a joke to make a serious point. A point which has nothing to do with the existence of a trill $ coin but with the stupidity of the current budget process."
Krugman's *not* joking.  On 7 January 2012 he wrote:
Should President Obama be willing to print a $1 trillion platinum coin if Republicans try to force America into default? Yes, absolutely. He will, after all, be faced with a choice between two alternatives: one thatâ€™s silly but benign, the other thatâ€™s equally silly but both vile and disastrous. The decision should be obvious. ...					False
1	2013-01-10 05:01:42	Deicas	Enter the platinum coin. Thereâ€™s a legal loophole allowing the Treasury to mint platinum coins in any denomination the secretary chooses. Yes, it was intended to allow commemorative collectorâ€™s items â€” but thatâ€™s not what the letter of the law says. And by minting a $1 trillion coin, then depositing it at the Fed, the Treasury could acquire enough cash to sidestep the debt ceiling â€” while doing no economic harm at all.
Then, on 8 January he wrote "Joe Weisenthal says that the coin debate is the most important fiscal policy debate of our lifetimes; I agree, with two slight quibbles â€” itâ€™s arguably more of a monetary than a fiscal debate, and itâ€™s really part of the broader debate that has been going on ever since we entered the liquidity trap."
If there is any joking in the coin issuance suggestion I can't find it.  If , or anyone else, is going to remove this edit claiming "joking" would they be so kind as to quote, from the cited columns, text that supports the "joking" claim.  â€” Preceding unsigned comment added by   â€¢ rebuttal_labels::

[31mDeicas: You make the assertion "To repeat: he's using a joke to make a serious point" but unresponsively fail to include any supporting information.  Per my request, above, "... be so kind as to quote, from the cited columns, text that supports the 'joking' claim". rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mVolunteer Marek: Ok, look, Krugman is using the whole trillion dollar coin example as a way of explaining why the current way that fiscal policy is conducted is absurd. Specifically, the fact that: ''"we have the weird and destructive institution of the debt ceiling; this lets Congress approve tax and spending bills that imply a large budget deficit â€” tax and spending bills the president is legally required to implement â€” and then lets Congress refuse to grant the president authority to borrow, preventing him from carrying out his legal duties and provoking a possibly catastrophic default."''. That's the whole point of the column. The coin is just a way of illustrating that. If the administration could just ignore the ridiculous debt ceiling threat then the idea of the coin would be moot. You're focusing on HOW the argument is presented, rather than WHAT the argument actually is. And this isn't about "supporting the claim", it's about simple reading comprehension.
More generally, the fact is that Krugman makes lots of points in a lot of columns. Should we include every single one in the article? Obviously not. If this coin idea gets implemented or something then yeah, sure, this particular column or two may be notable for inclusion. But right now it's just non-notable recentism (which usually, on Wikipedia turns into an oxymoronic phenomenon of outdated recentism) as this just happens to be something being discussed in the blogosphere at the moment. Just because it's in print somewhere does not mean it needs to be included. And especially it does not need to be included in a way which obfuscates and misses the main point. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mDeicas: Do I understand correctly that you are withdrawing the joking" claim?  Please clarify.
I am not clear whether you are saying that Dr. Krugman's policy recommendation that the US Treasury should be "minting a $1 trillion coin" is inappropriate for inclusion in  Paul_Krugman#U.S._economic_policies.  If you are making that claim, then please specifically state same and describe the criteria that you are using to make that judgement.
I am not clear whether you are saying that the edit in question does not adequately  describe the policy issue in question cf. "which obfuscates and misses the main point".  If you are making that claim, then please specifically state same and perhaps you would be so kind as to extend the edit in question to address your concern.  Does this extended description belong in Paul Krugman or Trillion_Dollar_Coin?
I am not aware that "recentism" is an accepted reason for edit reversion.  If you claim "recentism" as a reversion, then would you please cite the Wikipedia policy that describes "recentism". rebuttal_labels::

[34mMangoe: It's quite obvious that Krugman thinks that the coin is a stupid idea and that he's ridiculing other Republican policies as being even stupider. If this isn't the message you're getting from the articles, then perhaps you should consider stepping away from this topic. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mArzel: What is obvious to one, is not neccessarily obvious to another.  Krugman called the coin idea a gimmick, but he also called any gimmick to get around the budget ceiling a good idea.  I suppose you prefer to call Krugman's support of this gimmick to be a joke, because otherwise Krugman is just as stupid as the Republicans you are critical of. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mVolunteer Marek: Generally it's not a good idea to suppose stuff you have no basis for supposin'. Let's call it a "serious joke", ey? rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Stating your stance
[31mDeicas: I made the assertion, above, that "Krugman's *not* joking".  I supported that assertion with two quotes from two different Krugman columns. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mDeicas: I further support "Krugman's *not* joking" with this item, from a law professor, who believes Krugman's proposal is serious: http://althouse.blogspot.com/2013/01/hope-and-change-into-clown-costume.html. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mDeicas: If someone wants to claim that Krugman's joking, the burden is on them to: 1) find a suitable citation that references Krugman's Trillion_dollar_coin proposal enforcement; 2) says that Krugman's joking and; 3) insert into the edit under dispute something to the effect that "... but some say Krugman's endorment is only joking". rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mDeicas: I ask the questions, above, that you decline to answer, so that I can *clearly* understand your proposed solution (eg. put extended description in Trillion_Dollar_Coin, or, never cite the referenced Krugman columns in Paul Krugman ) and the reasoning for same. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mDeicas: I went to the trouble of asking the questions.  I ask that you go to the trouble of answering the each or, alternatively, explain why the question is not dispositive for the issue at hand. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mVolunteer Marek: Again, this isn't a matter of sourcing but a simple matter of reading comprehension. Pay attention to the part where he says ''He will, after all, be faced with a choice between two alternatives: one thatâ€™s silly but benign, the other thatâ€™s equally silly but both vile and disastrous'' though. And please stop trying to waste our time. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mDeicas: So Krugman observes that there is a bad solution ("silly but benign") and a worse solution ("equally silly but both vile and disastrous")?  So?  Politics & economics are *filled* with situations where the best solution is only least bad.  How does that support your undo-ing of the edit under dispute because "... he is too joking ..."? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mDeicas: Here is a citation that supports my "Krugman's *not* joking" claim:

[32mVolunteer Marek: This is about as ridiculous as me demanding that you present a source to the effect that "Krugman is NOT joking when he endorses the trillion dollar coin".  dammit! So. Go out there and find that, then come back here and play the passive-aggressive-recent-account-but-well-versed-in-Wikipedia-policy shtick and maybe I'll be willing to waste my time on being trolled. rebuttal_labels:: DH0: Name calling/hostility, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
