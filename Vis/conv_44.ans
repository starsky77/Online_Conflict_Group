[31mDontmakemetypepasswordagain: New section on criticism of the deal in its aftermath rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mDontmakemetypepasswordagain: I added a section of criticisms regarding the deal and its alleged ill effects.  I tried to keep it pretty dry and impeccably sourced.  Please have a look. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mDontmakemetypepasswordagain: I noticed that you added an NPOV tag to this section, complaining in the edit summary about it being a "pile" of "garbage" or "rot", and also complaining (in non-displaying template text) that the section contains "disreputable fringe views".
I'll set aside the question of whether referring to notable views by high-quality sources in high-quality publications as "garbage"â€”and complaining that another editor has had the nerve to ''actually cite'' themâ€”fosters a collegial editing atmosphere. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
[31mDontmakemetypepasswordagain: That having been set aside, the tag is plainly incorrect, and since you have dispensed with the usualy ''formality'' of attempting to substantiate the tag, I have dispensed with the formality of asking you to identify your complaints, and I just went ahead and removed the tag.  Please go read WP:FRINGE and do not restore the tag without an explanation of what the heck you're talking about. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mNPguy: I've removed a few bits that are either outrageous (the genocide claim) or irrelevant (the patrol boat story).  But it's still unbalanced both for the lack of favorable commentary and for the lack of rebuttals to the cited criticisms. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mNeutrality: Thanks. I fully agree with all of your removals and also agree that more work needs to be done to balance things out. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mNeutrality: I am restoring the tag that NPguy added. I cannot speak for NPguy, but there are major concerns here about the section that you added:
The patrol boat content is not relevant, and is in any case excessive. This incident literally has nothing to do with the JCPOA. Content on it belongs at 2016 U.S.â€“Iran naval incident, not here.  The incident is probably worthy of a sentence under "continued tensions," but no more.
The section is far too long - undue weight accorded to post-agreement criticism. It mainly recapitulates the sections on political criticism in the United States.
Strays from the article topic by going into detail (complete with lengthy quotes) about Iranian missiles. I am fine with including well-sourced criticism to the effect that missile controls should have been included in the JCPOA, but lengthy expositions on the missiles are simply irrelevant to the JCPOA.
Section is unbalanced - it is loaded up with paragraphs and paragraphs of material criticizing the agreement, yet no equivalent material that notes the agreement's successful implementation.
Because of these serious issues, I am restoring the tag. Do not remove it until the issues are worked out here. , can you weigh in here, particularly on the patrol-boat content? rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mDontmakemetypepasswordagain: Please do not edit dishonestly.  You have already been set straight on the Beres-"fringe" argument and there are simply no two ways about it.  Your "fringe" argument is silly and wrong, being contradicted by both the clear words and the plain underlying meaning of the policy itself, as well as the illustrative examples provided.  '''STOP.'''
You're also arguing that criticisms by the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee aren't entitled to ''any'' weight at all.  A silly claim, made with zero basis.  Also in connection with this improper removal: ''Huffington Post'' is cited extensively throughout this article.  That being the case, you will not remove commentary from such important figures based on further BS claims about ''Breitbart'' not being "reliable" to provide a ''transcript of quoted remarks''.
The patrol boat incident was relevant.  The relevance is stated in various sources, and not just the ones I cited.  The relevance is also ''obvious''.  You don't get to contradict sources simply because you want to ''pretend'' that relevant things "aren't relevant", and because the guiding principle of the JCPOA itself is for US negotiators to be stupidly blind to Iranian duplicity and pretend it has no bearing on the deal.  That idiotic fake reality is binding on Obama's negotiating team, but is not binding on the real world, the press, etc.; and it is not authoritative for Wikipedia articles, whereas RS commentaries ''are''. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mDontmakemetypepasswordagain: Please also note there is no WP policy whatsoever that recommends that important and well-sourced commentary be censored or otherwise excluded ''simply because you can't find a published rebuttal''.  If there are rebuttals, add them.  If there are no rebuttals, '''toughâ€”the unrebutted criticisms remain in the article'''.  Nor is the section a "recapitulation" of other criticismsâ€”by and large it pertains to Iran's increased provocation ''after and as a result of'' the deal. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mDontmakemetypepasswordagain: You're ''also'' arguing that criticisms by '''the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency''' aren't fit for inclusion because the publication they appeared in was ''The New York Post''.  This is just dumb, and I can't think of more obvious evidence that you are engaging in '''gamesmanship''' here. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mNPguy: See previous discussion about the genocide claim, which is deliberately inflammatory and cannot be taken seriously.  It is a fringe view. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mDontmakemetypepasswordagain: You are fully delusional and should be blocked for bad-faith editing.  You know that the policy does not support that edit and you have had it explained to you in clear terms.  Reverted. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[36mJoshua Issac: The patrol boat incident is irrelevant to criticism of the nuclear deal because although many sources (''The Telegraph'', ''Business Insider'', etc.) have written about it in conjunction with the deal, it has nothing to do with criticism, so it belongs elsewhere in the article. The ballistic missile test is relevant because sources have commented on whether it should have been covered under the deal, but and Israel's response to it is not (unless you can find a source that says Israel specifically mentioned the deal in relation to the test). I suggest you take a look at WP:SYN to help you determine what is relevant and what is not. And if you find someone, say, Shahi Hamid, opining that "JCPOA is bad", that does not belong in the article, because he is not notable, but if he writes "Secretary of State Jane Doe says the JCPOA is bad", then it belongs here because Jane Doe's opinion is notable in relation to foreign policy. Also, it is not helpful to insult editors (WP:CIVIL) or to divert the discussion topic ("That idiotic fake reality is binding on Obama's negotiating team", etc.; this page is for discussing the article's content and sources, not for discussing whether the nuclear deal is good or bad; see WP:TALK#USE). rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[34mNeutrality: I agree with NPguy and with Joshua, above, that you should be civil (and not to accuse others, like NPGuy, of "bad faith" editing). I would also caution you against re-adding this material (i.e., the long, meandering extract at the patrol-boat incident), because there is a firm consensus on this talk page (at least 3-1) against including it.:
The ''NY Post'' material is also problematic, and you've been informed of this. The ''Post'' is a lousy tabloid, and ought not to be used, particularly on complex and important subjects. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH5: Counterargument
[35mYagasi: It is a lost cause. You will not find even 3 righteous Wikipedians to break the consensus established by NPGuy and Neutrality. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mJoshua Issac: I have renamed the section previously named ''New sanctions'' to ''Continued tensions'', and moved the material on the ballistic missile tests there. I have also removed some of the claims that were in violation of WP:SYN (like "Iranian state press later boasted that...") and reworded some content to remove charged language taken from opinion pieces, so that it does not present the commentators' views as fact. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mNPguy: I am one of three editors who disagree with your edits.  You are clearly editing against consensus.  I did keep one piece, quoting Heinonen.  The claim in the National Review is opinion and factually incorrect. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH4: Stating your stance
[31mDontmakemetypepasswordagain: I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask for a little more discussion than that.  Please state what needs to be removed, and why.  If something needs to be shortened, please state why.  If some opinion is mistakenly being presented as fact, please show where.  If something being presented as fact is incorrect, please show where. Please be a little more cooperative here. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[31mDontmakemetypepasswordagain: I'm not going to further address the silly claim about a legal expert's opinion in an RS being "fringe".  Just stop, NPGuy.  Moving along, the missile launches and patrol boat incident were both explicitly connected to the nuclear deal in the source material, in one case by Pres. Obama, and in the WP prose, and I have also adjusted the WP prose to make that more clear. I restored the remarks by the IAEA chief and former deputy chief, using a Harvard Kennedy School of Government article portal and a ''National Review'' piece, although I think it is silly to exclude quoted remarks from major expert figures simply because you dislike the newspaper.  I restored the Robbins quotes, which were not at any time presented as fact, or as anything other than the quoted statements of Robbins, so I found that to be a puzzling accusation, but in any event I added some more textual attributions to shore it up a bit.  Aaaand last but not least NPGuy hasn't called my edits "garbage" or "rot" in the last 24 hours so I agree to be more civil just like him! Ok folks, I'll see you soon. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH-1: Bailing out
[33mGabeIglesia: All, I wanted to put it on everyone's radar that I decided to take this matter to the admin noticeboard, as this seems to be raising edit war red flags, and it also seems that this exchange has been going on for long enough. Pinging , , , and . Any others are also welcome. And if this is all just a premature action on my part and no action is going to be taken, my apologies for wanting some peace and clarity once and for all. ) But hopefully this steers the conversation in a new direction. Cheers. rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion
