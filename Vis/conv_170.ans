[31mNorth8000: Suggestion to resolve rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mNorth8000: This can and has become a soapbox-via-coatrack of the more general GMO debate.  While, of course, the talking points of the movement and responses to those could be considered germane, that's a slippery slope to duplicating the whole GMO debate here.  My suggestion:  have only a small amount of talking points here, and equal amounts from the two sides. ''North8000'' rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mViriditas: I'm not seeing any potential for a coatrack nor a soapbox.  Your advice is a prescription for disaster and follows the failed media equivalency model that the scholarly articles rail endlessly about, and the last time I saw it implemented was in the Tea Party movement article. This protest has eight primary issues raised by protesters (popular support, labeling laws, limits on corporate lobbying, product safety claims, private and public revolving door, loophole legislation, patent claims, and sustainable agriculture).  What is Monsanto's "side" to this? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mJytdog: As far as I am concerned, the reason for the Fringe tag were the statements (which I think no longer exist) saying that currently marketed foods from GMOs are actually dangerous.  This is not a "Monsanto point" - it is the scientific consensus.  There are not just two "sides".   Others here have raised Fringe issues about other statements that they felt did not accord with reality (which again is different from "Monsanto's side") - I am not sure what the status of those objections are.  No Wikipedia article should be "balanced" in the sense of giving both "sides" an equal voice - that is crazy.  But every Wikipedia article should make sure that there is nothing stated that is Fringe (with respect to reality as described in reliable secondary sources - not with respect to the "other side") that is not tempered somehow. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mViriditas: I would invite people to read other featured articles on protest movements, articles like Stonewall riots, for example.  All relevant talking points are discussed in their appropriate context.  This is neither a soapbox nor a coatrack. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[36mThargor Orlando: That's because there are people here willing to do the work to keep that from happening, instead of treating it as a space for unquestioned bunk science. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[36mThargor Orlando: I've re-added the assertions of consensus from scientific bodies to bring us in line with policy on the matter.  As long as that's in place in some form, I have no further objections, for the record.  Yes, North is right that this is likely to become a soapbox without vigilant editing, but it appears enough of us are up for it. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[32mViriditas: Except, ''you'' are the one presenting bunk science.  According to an article about GMOs in the May 2 issue of ''Nature'' (497, 24â€“26) , "Researchers, farmers, activists and GM seed companies all stridently promote their views, but the scientific data are often inconclusive or contradictory". rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH6: Refutation
[36mThargor Orlando: The overwhelming scientific consensus is that GM food is safe.  Period. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mViriditas: There is no such statement in that article, and there is no such consensus nor is it stated in those terms. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mThargor Orlando: Thus the need to add in the scientific consensus information.  You're wrong on this, and policy requires us to combat fringe science, period. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mViriditas: That's not a scientific consensus of any kind.  Even the latest issue of ''Nature'' disagrees with your old sources and notes the problems with GMOs and the contradictory science. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mNorth8000: Not that this will resolve it, but the general statement-of-question that is being tossed around here (GMO's: Safe or not?) is so broad/ambiguous that the conversation can never possibly more forward.   For example:
''Which''' GMO's are you talking about?  Certain ones?  The ones in common use?  The ones that haven't been tested yet?  The ones that are not yet invented but will be soon? Every GMO that might be ever invented?
''Safe from what?'''  Harming human health?   Against having ''any'' negative effects? (such as from encouraging farmer behaviors that breed superweeds?)
''What is the threshold for considering it safe?''' Proven by science (proof of a negative)? ....there is no such thing.  Generally accepted as safe (e.g. by immense testing / evidence?  No known problems?

[34mJytdog: Viriditas - I just want to point out the full quote from Nature that you put into the article, brings up some of the  issues around GM crops around which there is scientific uncertainty.  But please note that in that extended quote, the relative risk to human health of GM food that is currently marketed, is ''not'' mentioned as something that there is any real scientific uncertainty over. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[34mJytdog: Follow up note.  I just removed that source and content based on it, as it was written on May 1 and does not reference the MaM nor can it be a response to the MaM.  This wikipedia article is about MaM and is not about the controversy over food from GMOs - right? rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mJytdog: Thargor, in the flurry of commenting, please do not make overly broad statements like this - it does not help keep the issues clear. The consensus is ''not'' that "GM food is safe", and you know this.  I know it takes more time to type the whole thing but please do so. Thanks! rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH4: Repeated argument
[34mJytdog: Hi North8000.  Great question.  I have been trying to keep this clear, too.  The scientific consensus is about food (in other words, stuff that humans eat and its risks to human health) and is not about crops (from which food is produced) and goes like this: "currently marketed food from GMOs is as safe as (or as risky as, however you prefer) food from conventional counterpart organisms".  It is not about any conceivable GMO used in any conceivable way, nor is it about the effects of GM crops from which food is made on environment nor is it about applied chemicals (not the effect of these chemicals on the environment nor on ag worker health) nor is it about industrial agriculture per se nor is it is about patents or other market aspects - it is about currently marketed food from GMOs and it is relative, not absolute.  I very much appreciate your effort to keep this clear. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mThargor Orlando: I don't agree, the science statements regarding what's being discussed ''are'' clear. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[34mJytdog: I appreciate that you are working to make sure the scientific consensus is well represented but statements this broad are not helpful - they actually match the "straw man" that people who are worried about GMOs set up.  The statement that "GM food is safe" is not true, stated this broadly, nor is it supportable.   The consensus is 1) about currently marketed food from GMOs and 2) importantly, is ''not absolute (which is absurd) but rather is relative to food from conventional organisms.''  It is absurd to say "Water is safe" and it is absurd to say "Water is dangerous".  Please, please do not throw gasoline on the fire by making overly broad statements. This is hard enough without this.  Thanks. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument, DH3: Policing the discussion
[36mThargor Orlando: If you give an inch, they'll take a mile.  I've already been accused of being a paid shill for even considering that there's a scientific consensus, and including these caveats where they don't belong in this article is, while noble and understandable, doing more harm than good.  When the argument is that GM foods are unsafe, the fringe position being put out there is wrong.  I have no problem with including the language as it is stated in the reliable sources for the article, but there's no need to mince words here. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[35mGroupuscule: suggests that little scientific consensus exists on any issue pertaining to GMOs. This would include the claim that "currently marketed" genetically modified foods are "as safe as food from conventional counterpart organisms". Indeed, if any relevant scientific consensus ''does'' exist, it is that techniques of genetic engineering may well have unintended effects on the host organismâ€”and can therefore ''not'' be presumed equivalent to a combination of ancestor plant + new genes. This claim amounts to saying 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts', a piece of conventional wisdom which Big Scienceâ„¢ has now borne out. Also: many genetically modified foods that are "currently marketed" in the US are banned as unsafe in other countries. As North8000 points out, "safe" is an very imprecise medical claim that Wikipedia almost never makes. That the claim of "safety" has been pushed so heavily for this relatively untested class of foods is astounding. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mJytdog: whoosh.  Not sure how to respond to this. I am accurately stating the scientific consensus, which is a nuanced statement (nuance is different than "giving an inch").  You will do as you will.   Good luck! rebuttal_labels:: DH-1: Bailing out, DH4: Repeated argument
