{'text': "This article as presently written presents in significant degree only the French perspective.  What is missing is significant descriptions of diplomatic activities of the Iroquois and other native parties, especially in dealings with the English, who are only mentioned as traders. (They claimed to be guarantors of Iroquois security, but failed to do so in King William's War.) English diplomacy and frontier activity had an impact on the negotiations leading to Montreal, which is not mentioned.  (The Iroquois in 1698-1701 conducted diplomacy both in Montreal and Albany, and also concluded a significant agreement in Albany in 1701 that furthered English imperial objectives; none of this is mentioned here.)  The imperial ambitions of both England and France (claiming some sort of sovereign control over Iroquoia) is also missing. For these deficiencies of content I have reduced the assessment to Start.

{'text': 'You are correct, the article is missing alot of information. Your caricaturization of bias is a little incorrect though. THe English are mentioned as more than traders, but as allies of the Iroquois, and the results impacted the French much more than the English, so its only fitting to discuss that more. I think its best to look at this article in the context of the Beaver Wars - another article needing work. Please feel free to improve them both. I disagree with the downgrading to start class, it is a weak C according the assessment scale. —\xa0\xa0|\xa0', 'username': 'Charles Edward', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}

{'text': "As far as the English as allies: the problem is that Iroquois politics isn't that simple.  While the Covenant Chain existed as a formal alliance, there were significant factions that were either neutral or pro-French within the league, and all of this is absent here.  I only came to this article because I've been working on Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont, the governor of MA/NH/NY 1698-1701, and was exposed to this in researching his role in frontier negotiations.  Agreed that the impact of this treaty was of greatest importance to the French and the Iroquois, but the English (in particular Bellomont) tried to stop the negotiations.  (One major reason for their failure in this was, as far as I've read, their inability to actually protect the Iroquois as promised in the Covenant Chain.)\nSignificantly improving the article would require more research into Iroquois politics than I'm presently prepared to do.

{'text': 'Further instances of bias:\nFrontenac defeats the English at Quebec in 1690.  Why were the English at Quebec in fall 1690?  Because of three Frontenac-orchestrated attacks on the New England frontiers.  Why did those happen? (1) war declared in Europe (2) reprisal for Lachine massacre.  Why did Lachine massacre happen?  Not sure of proximate causes, but the chain clearly goes back further.  Now, you obviously don\'t have to present this entire context \'\'here\'\', but as presently stated the article leaves me with a strong impression that the English (and by extension the Iroquois) are the aggressors, when the history is clearly somewhat more nuanced.  (Sources: see for example Peckham, \'\'The Colonial Wars\'\', or Kingsford for Frontenac\'s role in the 1690 French offensive.)\nThe whole last paragraph of the Aftermath, while I accept its basic truth (even though it isn\'t cited), is relatively unvarnished French-Canadian boosterism and is not well-connected to the rest of the article.  A discussion of French strategy for dealing with North American natives vs. that of other nations would be appropriate in a background section (not the aftermath).\nFrench followed their long-used reasonable policy - "reasonable" is POV\nThe Great Peace of Montreal is a unique diplomatic event - uncited POV\n\'\'\'', 'username': 'Magicpiano', 'rebuttal_labels': ['DH5: Counterargument'], 'coordination_labels': []}
