[31mMuntuwandi: NPOV rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMuntuwandi: On one hand this incident is quite minor. My first impression is that this incident does not have the enduring notability necessary for it to have a long term future on Wikipedia. I sincerely doubt that in five or ten years time there will be much discussion concerning this controversy. It is possible that it could grow legs and start to run. If there is some scandalous email or recorded phone conversation from the DOJ, anything could happen. But barring such a revelation, I don't see this incident having long term notability, similar to WP:NOTNEWS.
I consider the tone of this article not neutral and have added the NPOV tag. Captain Occam has attempted to preemptively address neutrality problems by including some criticisms of how some conservatives have handled the case. The New Black Panther Party is a fringe group that has made a series of highly controversial and divisive statements in its history. But I do think that in this article, the NBPP has been set up as a punching bag, a sort of strawman. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mCaptain Occam: Whether or not this case is notable enough to deserve its own article was discussed here and here, and every editor who expressed an opinion about this agreed with me that it was.  That was in July.  If anything, the case‚Äôs notability has only grown since then, since that was before Christopher Coates offered his testimony about this case as well as before the DOJ‚Äôs inspector general began his investigation about it.
If anyone else thinks this case isn‚Äôt notable, then they can start an AFD about the article, but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much question what the outcome of any such AFD would be.  This topic has about the same level of notability as the Resignation of Shirley Sherrod, which was nominated for deletion in July.  The deletion discussion about that article lasted barely a day, before being closed early as ‚Äúkeep‚Äù per WP:SNOW.  I think we can expect any AFD about this article to have a similar result. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mCaptain Occam: Something you need to keep in mind about this article is that the case it covers has received more coverage from conservative news sources than from liberal ones, and both conservative and liberal news sources have pointed this out.  NPOV policy requires articles here to contain the same proportion of perspectives that exists in reliable sources, so in order for the article to comply with NPOV policy, that proportion of conservative and liberal viewpoints needs to be reflected in the article.  According to WP:TAGGING, any tag for an article should be accompanied by an explanation of what‚Äôs wrong with the article, and if none is provided it‚Äôs appropriate to remove the tag.  All you‚Äôve said about your reason for tagging the article is ‚ÄúI consider the tone of this article not neutral‚Äù, which does not tell me anything about what specific parts of the article you think are biased, or even in which direction you think they‚Äôre biased.  (I suspect that you think the article has a conservative bias, but you haven‚Äôt even made that clear.)  Therefore, I am going to remove the tag until someone can explain more specifically what NPOV problems there are with this article, in a way that would make it possible for them to be fixed. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mMuntuwandi: You have given a blow by blow account of the controversy, mostly from a conservative perspective. However this blow by blow dramatic account tends to give undue weight to the controversy. You have used several quotes but most of your quotes have been cherry picked from conservative sources, and there is much less criticism of conservatives. The article assumes that the incident is very important, whereas most mainstream outlets have not considered the story as one of their top priorities. In short, in this article,  the NBPP is the punching bag, and the justice department was wrong to dismiss the case. This is why I believe the article isn't neutral rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mCaptain Occam: ‚Äúmost mainstream outlets have not considered the story as one of their top priorities‚Äù
That‚Äôs simply false.  I recommend that you take a look at the  I‚Äôve assembled in my userspace to get an idea of the mainstream news coverage this case has received.  So far there have been six articles about this case from the Washington Post, five from the Associated Press, four from CNN, and so on.  This case would be notable even if were to completely ignore the coverage it‚Äôs received from conservative sources.  (Not that we should, since that would be a blatant NPOV violation.)
I also don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs possible for the article to ‚Äúgive undue weight to the controversy‚Äù over this case.  The article is ''about'' the controversy over this case, because the controversy over it is what every one of the news articles about it is discussing.  How is it possible for an article to give undue weight to its entire subject matter? rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mCaptain Occam: And you aren‚Äôt acknowledging my point about the article needing to accurately reflect the balance of viewpoints that exists in the source literature about this case, which are more conservative than liberal.  Until you address this point, and provide specific examples of things that you think ought to be changed about this article, there‚Äôs nothing for us to discuss here. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mMuntuwandi: I didn't say that mainstream outlets haven't covered the story, only that it is not a top priority for them. There are not enough arguments from mainstream outlets that suggest that this incident is "very small potatoes". Sure there is a section on media coverage, but there isn't enough information about how this story is actually being hyped up and driven by conservative outlets. In my opinion, this is more of a story about a story. The actual incident is close to being irrelevant. The fallout is more seemingly more important than the actual events. I think these news items give a better representation of the media coverage and the controversy as a whole. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mCaptain Occam: Since articles at Politico are not checked for accuracy by an editorial board, I don‚Äôt think articles there satisfy WP:RS.  However, there is already an entire section devoted to the main subject of the Politico article you linked to, which is Abigail Thernstrom‚Äôs criticism of the investigation about this case.  And the NPR article that you linked to is already cited here.
NPOV policy requires that each aspect of this case be given about the same amount of space in the Wikipedia article that it‚Äôs given in reliable sources discussing the case.  Of the 100 or so news articles that I‚Äôve found about this case in reliable sources, there are around eight that focus on the media coverage it‚Äôs getting.  In other words, around 8% of the source material about this case is discussing the media coverage it‚Äôs received, with the other 92% of the source material being about various aspects of the case itself.  Therefore, in order to comply with NPOV policy, discussion about this case‚Äôs media coverage should take up around 8% of the article.  That‚Äôs pretty close to the amount of space that it currently has. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mMuntuwandi: I got the NPR item from the article, but a lot of the information from the source isn't included in the article. Such percentages are unscientific and misleading, especially given how a single news item can be duplicated in an infinite number of ways over the internet. In time I will proceed to make some adjustments to bring some neutrality to the article, I will use sources such as those mentioned above. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mMuntuwandi: The article has major NPOV issues that I will start address in the coming days. The article could also do with some trimming because sometimes less is more. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mCaptain Occam: If you actually are intending to try and improve the article, I hope it‚Äôs going to involve more than just blanking large sections of content.  There may well be parts of the article that could be worded in a more neutral or more concise manner, but I don‚Äôt think there are any entire sections or paragraphs that it would be reasonable to just delete, the way you‚Äôve often done on race and intelligence articles.  Your other method of trying to improve articles, by reverting them back several months to an earlier version you liked better, also isn‚Äôt going to work in this case because the article doesn‚Äôt have an earlier version to revert it to.  (Unless you intend to turn it back into a redirect, which is completely inappropriate for a topic with this level of notability.)
I‚Äôd also suggest that you seek consensus for any major changes you‚Äôre intending to make. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mCaptain Occam: Some of the changes you‚Äôve made to this article appear to be worthwhile, so I‚Äôm not going to do a blanket revert, but it would have been better if you‚Äôd discussed them here first.  There are definitely some changes you‚Äôve made that I don‚Äôt approve of, such as sourced content that you‚Äôve blanked without any explanation why, and unsourced statements that you've added about living people. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mMuntuwandi: Initially I didn't do a thorough job of sourcing. I have added the sources that were missing, so all the material should be backed up. I can provide clarification if needed. To go over a few points
The criminal investigation was dropped by the Bush administration, not the Obama administration.
According to Perez's testimony
'Whereas, the original complaint sought an unlimited injunction prohibiting acts of intimidation anywhere in the United States, the final relief sought by the Department was limited solely to the City of Philadelphia and was only to last through November of 2012''
So I have added this text to explain what exactly the reduction in scope entailed.
As for the Reactions in Congress vs Republicans in congress, I just wanted to point out that it is not a bipartisan concern, rather it is a few republican congress people who are driving the issue.
According to Adam's testimony
MR. BLACKWOOD:  Was there any indication that anyone higher up than Loretta King or Steve Rosenbaum was making the decision to override the six career attorneys who said the case should go forward?
MR. ADAMS:  None that I had any indication of.
This is still a Bush administration controversy, because it started prior to the Obama administration, and is also related to the Noxubee- Ike Brown case. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMuntuwandi: I have just added some information that states that the individuals who decided to dismiss the case against the NBPP, King and Rosenbaum, had served in the justice dept under both Bushes and several other presidents. They were temporarily "promoted" to acting AAG under the Obama administration, but they were still DOJ insiders. This may help clear up what actually happened. One could easily get the impression that the decision to dismiss the case came directly from the White House. While not impossible, the evidence seems to suggest that a lot of the deliberation was internal to the DOJ and that disputes over how to handle such incidents commenced in the Bush administration, and not the Obama administration. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mCaptain Occam: I don‚Äôt have a problem with including this information, but we also need to make it clear that what‚Äôs currently being reported by reliable secondary sources is that political appointees may have been heavily involved in the decision to drop the case, and that the DOJ has tried to conceal their involvement.  An example of an article pointing this out out is this article in the Washington Post, which is a fairly mainstream and non-partisan news channel. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMuntuwandi: One issue is the characterization of political appointees. Usually we think of a political appointee as someone who comes from outside the department to enforce the governing administration's policies. In this case the political appointees who made the decision to dismiss, King and Rosenbaum, were not from outside, but were veterans of the DOJ. Conservative critics would like to give the impression that their decision to dismiss came from higher up, that is from the AG or the White House. This is not impossible, but it also seems likely that their decision may have been influenced by baggage from their long careers in the department, rather than any direct influence from higher ups. According to Adam's testimony, there was already tension in the DOJ about how to handle racial issues long before the Obama administration took office. The DOJ was also under a lot of pressure from civil rights groups when it came to pursuing cases against minorities. Blaming the Obama administration for what is partly a pre-existing dispute seems to be a bit of an exaggeration. This is why a number of sources have described the controversy as phony, faux or as a manufactured scandal. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMuntuwandi: As for the Washington Post article, it doesn't give the whole story. The draft report that states that political appointees were involved in the decision to dismiss was created by the conservative dominated US Civil Rights Commission. It is the report that the democratic commissioner Michael Yaki, walked out on in order to prevent a vote when he described the commission as a Kangaroo court. The draft report was leaked to TPMMuckraker, so it is not officially out. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mCaptain Occam: It looks like I initially cited the wrong article in this paragraph.  I‚Äôve fixed the ref now, and clarified which political appointees are suspected to have been involved in the decision. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mCaptain Occam: Something you need to realize about this article (and all Wikipedia articles, for that matter) is that the perspectives we present in it can only be the perspectives that exist in reliable secondary sources.  You‚Äôve added a lot of information to this article that‚Äôs cited to primary sources, such as unedited transcripts of testimony before the Civil Rights Commission.  That isn‚Äôt in itself a problem, but it isn‚Äôt appropriate for you to use your understanding of the case from these kinds of sources as a basis for disputing what the ''Washington Post'' is reporting about it.  If the ''Washington Post'' doesn‚Äôt give the whole story, and neither do any other reliable secondary sources, then Wikipedia can only give as much of the story as what these sources are reporting.  That‚Äôs just how Wikipedia works. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mMuntuwandi: The CNN article gives a more accurate account, than the Washington Post. The CNN article is a reliable secondary source, so I believe it should supersede the Washington Post article. The title "possible involvement of political appointees" reads like a leading question and would appear to violate NPOV. Some claim that political appointees were not involved and some claim that they were involved. Therefore it is appropriate for neutrality to take neither side. I can't find much on Hans Spakovsky, it seems the only articles that have published anything are Foxnews and The National Review. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mCaptain Occam: As I said, Wikipedia can only present information that‚Äôs published in reliable sources.  So if National Review and Fox News are the only sources that talk about Spakovsky, then that‚Äôs all we can present about him here.  (I think it‚Äôs better to cite National Review than Fox News, since there seems to be some dispute over how reliable Fox News is.)
The CNN article that you linked to is already cited here, for the part of the article which talks about Yaki walking out of the commission meeting.  This article doesn‚Äôt discuss the question of the extent that political appointees were involved in the decision to dismiss the case, so I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs possible for it to supersede what the Washington Post is reporting about that.  I understand your point that the draft is what Yaki walked out of the meeting in order to prevent a vote about, but unless a reliable source is disputing what the Washington Post has reported about political involvement ''specifically for this reason'', for Wikipedia to use Yaki‚Äôs reaction as a basis to dispute this would be an example of WP:SYNTH.  Remember, we can‚Äôt present any conclusions here that don‚Äôt exist in the source material. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mMuntuwandi: What I meant was that the Washington Post does not explicitly mention that the draft report was leaked to TPMMuckraker as the CNN article does. The Washington Post does not mention that the leaked report was not the final draft. The CNN articles states
'Reynolds confirmed the draft document is authentic, but said it is not the most recent summary that the commission would have voted on Friday had there been a quorum. He declined to immediately release the newest version, and would not describe what revisions may have been made.''
You write
'The Washington Post reported that according to a draft report from the Civil Rights Commission, political officials had been extensively involved in the decision to dismiss the case, and that the Department of Justice had attempted to conceal their involvement.''
But this statement is out of context and even obsolete because the draft that the Washington Post is referring to is not the final draft, is not official but a leaked version and has not even been voted on by the commission. This was why I mentioned that the CNN article supersedes the Washington Post because it has these extra details. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mCaptain Occam: As you might have noticed, I‚Äôve added some of the additional details from the CNN article to clarify that the leaked draft wasn‚Äôt the final version.  However, I think for this part of the article to discuss Yaki walking out of the meeting would be getting too close to WP:SYNTH.  The CNN article discusses Yaki‚Äôs reaction without discussing the report‚Äôs accusations of political interference, and the Washington Post article discusses the report‚Äôs accusations about this but not Yaki‚Äôs reaction, so for us to bring up Yaki‚Äôs reaction in order to dispute what the report says about this is making a point that doesn‚Äôt exist in the source material.  I think Yaki‚Äôs walking out of the meeting should be discussed later in the ‚ÄúCivil Rights Commission‚Äù section, where it currently is. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mMuntuwandi: I am not particular about the details. The main point is that the accusations from the USCCR are not official yet. When they draft is voted on and the final report is officially made public, not just leaked, then the USCCR would have declared its position. It wouldn't be inappropriate to report speculative or unofficial claims that appear in reliable secondary sources, but these claims should be placed in their proper context. rebuttal_labels::
