[31mKautilya3: My two cents. Since it was decided that British Mirpuri is the appropriate title for that page, it would be preferable to use that term in this article. You can of course make it clear that they are from the Azad Kashmir, and that they are often called "British Kashmiri," but the general reference to them throughout the article should British Mirpuri. Otherwise, you can do another RfC, but it is fairly predictable how it would go. Cheers, rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mMar4d: We should follow the source cited. If a source says Kashmiri, then I do not see why that should be discarded in favour for use of another term. It is not a good idea to discard reliable sources and leave this article to the interpretation of a single Wikipedia user. '''''' rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mHuman3015: Mar4d reported me on ANI  for abuse of twinkle, here discussion is going on regarding content and he want to focus attention elsewhere when he has nothing to defend himself. No one is agree on his POV. Â  rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mMar4d: I am not going to respond to your incivility. Focus on the content. Once again, I would like to ask you, can you explain why you reverted my restoration despite a source being given? '''''' rebuttal_labels:: DH3: Policing the discussion, DH4: Stating your stance
[34mHuman3015: You gave this 74 pages government document, now on which page it is mentioned, as I see on page 9, they have used word "Mirpuri". Â  rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mMar4d: Here's an easy solution: Press CTRL + F, search Kashmiri. Then check how many times it uses Kashmiri. I can't find much usage of Mirpuri, I think it only used 4 or 5 times. Be aware of WP:Source falsification, claiming that the source uses Mirpuri over Kashmiri is an example of that. ''''''

[34mHuman3015: Read page 7 of that government document, clearly mentioned "Mirpuris". You have not given page number of your latest comment. Moreover, your comment also says that they are called as "Mirpuris". Â  rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mHuman3015: page 7 says  Â  rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mHuman3015: I just have to mention that, if UK govenrment has used word "Mirpuris" and they are actually Mirpuris, also there is article named British Mirpuris then why we should use confusing term "Kashmiris"? You can see talk page of British Mirpuris which failed in move discussion to move it to British Kashmiris. We have communitty consensus for "Mirpuri".Â  rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mHuman3015: See RfC here, where Mar4d himself voted against it. Now he has changed his stand. We have community consesus that word "Mirpuri" should be used. We have sources too. While "Kashmiri" is confusing term. Â  rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mMar4d: That discussion was over the title of a different article, and the only reason why Mirpuris was retained was to differentiate it from other Kashmiris. Otherwise, that article's title should have been British Kashmiri were it not for that factor. As per my knowledge, there has never been any consensus for this article why Kashmiris should not be used here along with Mirpuris, when we have a vast number of sources which use both terms equally. '''''' rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mMar4d: I am not sure why you are asking me for page number when I have given you the complete source? This shows that either you are deficient in being able to check sources and therefore are incompetent to participate in this discussion as you've not read the source, or it shows that you are cherry-picking a usage of your choice to claim that your favoured term is used over another term (Kashmiri), which the sources uses more frequently. That is a form of WP:Source falsification. How do you defend this selective reasoning? '''''' rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[31mKautilya3: Wikipedia is supposed to represent the ''scholarly consensus''. You argument of "follow the source" suggests that you might cherry-pick sources to support your view point. But you have to represent ''all'' the scholarly opinions. - rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mMar4d: But that is exactly what Human3015 is ''not'' doing. We have scholarly sources, and both terms are used in abundance, Mirpuri/Kashmiri. What Human3015 is doing is removing all references of the term 'Kashmiri' from the article, which is wrong, as the sources cited do not explicity favour one term over another. Both terms are used commonly, and therefore the article in its original shape is accurate, as it follows the sources and uses both terms where context requires so. As you say, we have to represent ''all'' scholarly opinions, and that would necessitate not giving preferential use to one term only. I quoted a source below which says Mirpuris are commonly referred to as Kashmiris, and we have more indeed. '''''' rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mMar4d: Another problem with blanketing all of them under 'Mirpuris' is that Not all people from Azad Kashmir are neccessarily from Mirpur only. Hence, it is a minor issue when you use a placename demonym to lump all under that designation. '''''' rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mKautilya3: (ec) There is no requirement that we should use every term used in every source. We have to write Wikipedia coherently. If it is clear that the same group of people are being referred to, there is no harm in changing the label in our write-up. Between the two terms, British Mirpuri is preferable, as decided by the RfC on Talk:British Mirpuri. - rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mMar4d: WP:VERIFIABILITY says: ''Content is determined by previously published information rather than the beliefs or experiences of its editors. Even if you're sure something is true, it must be verifiable before you can add it. When reliable sources disagree, present what the various sources say, give each side its due weight, and maintain a neutral point of view''. As such, we are ''bound'' to represent all sources accurately and should not discard one view for another. The RfC on Talk:British Mirpuri is not relevant, as that was for deciding the accurate title of that article, not for the validity of the term 'Kashmiri' or 'Mirpuri'.

[31mKautilya3: In that case, I am afraid you have to do another RfC or take it to WP:DRN. - rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
