[31mGuccisamsclubs: Yes there are sources that call him revisionist, but ALL of them refer a book written 1985. So its highly misleading to imply that these attacks on Getty's "revisionism" take into account his voluminous later work. And Getty's main "revisionist" sin appears to be his thesis that Stalin was far from the only one to blame, and that other apparatchiks also had a stake in the purges. His argument is that the culprit was the system. The thesis is seems pretty sensible and is in fact ''more'' damning of the Soviet system that "traditional" Stalin-centric accounts. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH4: Stating your stance
[32mBrustopher: Getty is definitely within the revisionist school and people who agree with him such as Fitzpatrick described themselves as within a self-identified revisionist school (can't recall if he does). However, this article clearly seems to be biased against Getty by ommission, leaving out the nature of his later work in the archives which is far less dubious. I would remedy this but I've recently graduated and lost access to all my resources. Furthmore, while I may remembering completely wrong I dont believe Getty ever denied responsibility to Stalin completely for the purges (and the one source mvbw quoted doesnt seem to necessarily indicate this.  Also there's an article in Kritika 5:1 in response to Martin Malia (which I no longer have access too), which is a really good rebuttal to comparisons between Getty and Irving that have been included in this article, and probably needs to be included for the sake of balance. If anyone has access to this can they please add it. For the time being I'm adding a NPOV tag. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mMy very best wishes: If you want to include more sourced materials that describe his work in a more "positive" light, you are very welcome. There is no any disagreement about it, and therefore no reason for NPOV tag. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mGuccisamsclubs: . I am not saying that Getty's work is not "revisionist". The problem is how the term is used in the article. First, "American revisionist historian" is used to ''define'' Getty in the lede sentence. "Revisionist" is not definitive in the same way that "American historian" is. But even worse than this, is how the term "revisionism" is itself defined further down. The article cites only attacks on Getty, which paint Getty's revisionism as: part of a "gaggle"; analogous to holocaust denier David Irving; a "rehabilitation of Stalin". And as we both agree, the article takes his outdate ''Origins of the Great Purges'' as the point of departure to attack his revisionism, ignoring all later work. All in all, "revisionist" is used in the article as a slur that sets the tone for an attack piece, not as a neutral description of his work. This is why I recommended moving the term out of the lede sentence.
Other than that, I wholeheartedly agree with your points about neutrality. You don't need your institution to get the sourcesâ€”you can get them all from sci(dash)hub(dot)cc. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mMy very best wishes: He ''is'' usually mentioned in sources as a "revisionist sovietologist", i.e. here. Others describe him as "Stalin's apologist" , and this is not based on any his individual book, but based on everything he published. No wonder, because he claims that Great Purge was not planned by Stalin, among other things. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mGuccisamsclubs: Have you read Getty? Can you cite where he says Stalin was not to blame? If so add it to the article. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mGuccisamsclubs: American Neocon publications  (''weekly standard'' and to a lesser extent ''world affairs'') are not sufficient to label a living person as "Stalin apologist". Clearly, Soviet studies are a politicized field due to the Cold War, so it's not surprising to see some axe-grinding and insults in print. It is therefore easy to cherry pick the most ''extreme'' attacks on Getty and make an article out of them, ignoring what Getty actually wrote and ignoring the hundreds of academic sources that take his work seriously. This article basically likens him to David Irving and that's absolutely insane. rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument, DH5: Counterargument
[32mBrustopher: Having read through my old history notes again, Getty doesn't say that Stalin isnt to blame and has no responsibility. He instead says that he is rejected a "Great men" style of history and instead focusing on the structural causes of the Great Terror within society and the state (letter to the editors of Kritika 5:1), and that the style of Marxist ideology of the Soviet Union required the creation of paranoid conspiracies in response to failuire (Road to Terror, written with Naumov). The style this article is written however does seem to imply that he's a dodgy Stalin lover. In particular the way the Kirov question was put right after the thing about Irving to equate the question of who was responsible for Kirov's assassination (by no means a solved question) to Holocaust denial. The praise Getty's later work has received from people who are undeniably 100% anti-Stalinist such as Roy Medvedev, make the weighting of this article very biased. Also on a more negative note, Getty pre-archival numbers for victims of the purges were notoriously low, so if there's anywhere it's right for the article to be more negative it's there. With regards to the revisionism label, would it help if I include a link to historical revisionism in the lede? Getty is basically one of the most well known historians of the Soviet Revisionist school, so to leave out the fact that he is a Revisionist from the lede would be a grave omission. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[31mGuccisamsclubs: The lede is fine for now, although I still think its a good idea to remove "revisionist" from the lede definition, if not necessarily the lead section. I would not be surprised at all if Getty's numbers from the 1980's were notoriously low, but I've searched his landmark ''Origins'' and found no estimates of any kind there. The only citable secondary source I found on this is Haynes & Kler's Denial'', a book devoted to smoking out academics perceived as soft on Communism. If Getty ever put out a low estimate, I am sure they'd be all over it:
'In Denial'' is a one of the more worthwhile citations in the article (unlike World Affairs and Conquest's letters to the editor), though it needs to be cited a little more accurately and not in Wikipedia's voice. Quotes from Getty on this issue would be helpful too. On the other hand, Getty ''repeatedly'' cites Khrushchev's claim about Stalin signing several hundreds lists of victims, so I am not sure how far H&K;'s allegation that Getty saw stalin as a "moderate" who was not responsible for much repression can be taken. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mKingsindian: The question of whether Getty is to be described as "revisionist" in the lead.  Firstly, several sources cited above (this) and this) refer to Getty's "revisionist" work, not Getty as a "revisionist historian" (several do say the latter). Secondly, do most of the scholarly sources describe him as "revisionist"? That has not been argued, let alone shown. Thirdly, a description can be accurate without being the primary or even useful descriptor. Niall Ferguson is conservative, Robert Conquest was anti-Communist, E. H. Carr was leftist somewhat sympathetic to communism: none of them are described with a descriptor. Eric Hobsbawm is indeed described as Marxist, so there's that on the other side. The question is: what does the insertion of the label "revisionist" add except giving a faint aura of "not mainstream"? I am removing it for now since I do not think WP:ONUS is satisfied.

[31mGuccisamsclubs: I'm fine with removing it from the lead entirely since "revisionism" is already mentioned in body. Anything but "is an American revisionist historian" in the opening sentence is OK by me. Having said that, the POV issues identified by Brustopher seem more serious, so I hope we won't get bogged down arguing over label placement. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance

Each time, within days (or as in the last case) hours, someone comes in and deletes my additions and changes and re-introduces baseless attacks, including even insisting on a false job title for me after I had corrected it!

[32mBrustopher: This isnt just a vague descriptor, revisionism was clearly defined school of thought in Soviet historiography that was opposed to the approach of the totalitarian school. Authors such as Sheila Fitzpatrick self-identified as revisionists (don't know if Getty did), and its a commonly used label when discussing the works of historians of the Soviet Union such as Getty. To leave it out of the lede would be like writing an article on Marc Bloch and failing to mention the Annales School in the lede. Revisionism isnt a dirty word in historiography and doesnt mean "not mainstream." Indeed some revisionist schools such as that of the English Reformation are very much more mainstream than those they were initially "revising" (for lack of a better word). It's only bc we live in bizarro-world of Wikipedia, where bands of "rational skeptics" roam the land making every single article all about them and how great they are at debunking things, that the title of revisionism (appropriated by the Nazis and holocaust deniers for credibility) is associated with pseudohistory. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[34mMy very best wishes: I agree. To put it simple, his work was described as "revisionist" in almost every 3rd party source, especially by people who do not belong to his "school". Perhaps this should be clarified/balanced by quoting/using more sources. Now, speaking about our rules, word "revisionist" was on the page for a long time, i.e. in stable version.

[33mCarrite: Brustopher is 100% on the mark with everything he says above, this speaking as someone who did a year of grad school in Russian area studies in the late 1980s and was an outspoken revisionist at a school (University of Washington) dominated by traditionalists. Since then, the archives have opened, and what do you know, the scholarly estimates of executions in the Terror of 1937-38 by historians like Jerry Hough and Arch Getty (< 1 million) turned out to be on the mark, vs. the gross exaggerations for political effect by traditionalist/totalitarian school historians like Conquest and Solzhenitsyn, who argued tens of millions. The so-called revisionists were more or less right, the conservatives way off â€” imagine that. Today the ''big majority of historians of the Soviet Union in the United States'' are more or less new historians/cultural historians/social historians/bottom-up historians (whatever you want to call the so-called Revisionists) and the number of Cold War totalitarian sword clangers is very small â€” basically because their fundamental premise of an unchanging totalitarianism, unchangeable through internal forces, was belied by Gorbachev and the events after. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
