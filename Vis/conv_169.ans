[31mFactchecker25: Page Move rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mFactchecker25: Based on prior talk posts, article has been renamed to reflect its subject matter. Eugene Plotkin is just one of six co-conspirators involved in the inside trading scheme and does not appear to be notable outside the scope of the scheme. Subsequent media coverage suggests other participants and David Pajcin in particular are notable within the scope of the inside trading scheme, but none are notable beyond the scope of the scheme. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mSmallbones: I've moved the page back.  There was no consensus for a move.  There has been a history of rather crude games here, e.g. flocks of sockpuppets, deleting cited material, then filing for AfD.  We can discuss introducing new information, but hiding old well-cited info is not needed.  If I feel somebody is trying to censor me here, I will just inform the proper notice boards and administrators and there will be no censoring.  Doing this every 6 months is getting tedious.

[31mFactchecker25: Remove 33% of new content, remove new references, and restore old references, many of which are not working properly? This is vandalism. Please do refer this to the proper notice boards and let us get a general discussion going, but this article is not "owned" by a particular editor. What is getting tedious is the clear campaign to keep the article limited in scope and lacking in NPOV. We can have a discussion on the talk page or on the notice boards, but that discussion needs to be completed with mutual respect before extensive edits and additions are simply removed. There has been a history of improper edits with this page, and the current attempt to keep new cited information out and challenge the expansion of scope is an extension of that impropriety. There have been particular individuals who have rolled back every edit as if this article is their own domain. That is not what Wikipedia is about. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument, DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[34mTheRedPenOfDoom: it is ENTIRELY Appropriate to keep an article focused on the actual subject of the article. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[36mAndyTheGrump: A simple question: what is the subject of this article? It is entitled 'Eugene Plotkin', but appears in fact to be almost entirely devoted to an insider trading scheme involving six different people. Why is the article about one of the individuals (who appears to be notable for nothing else), rather than the insider trading scheme? rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mFactchecker25: That is exactly the point. What is notable is the scheme, which is the reason for the move and the expansion of the NPOV. Article struck me as being biased to artificially focus on a particular individual even though the media coverage was clearly devoted to the scheme and the most recent coverage focused on other members of the group. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mFactchecker25: Please stop undoing my revisions until a full discussion can take place on the BLP notice board. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mTheRedPenOfDoom: (e/c) and do you have a suggested name for the article about the scheme? All of the coverage is about Plotkin's involvement (and not about others' involvement) and the media did not seem to give it a nifty name. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mFactchecker25: That is simply not true. All of the coverage is not about Plotkin's involvement. There is significant coverage regarding Pajcin, Shpigelman, and Smith. The most recent coverage is about Pajcin. There is less coverage about Renteria and Schuster, but they had an admittedly lesser role in the scheme. The coverage does focus repeatedly on Business Week and Reebok, which is why I moved the page to "Business Week and Reebok Inside Trading Ring". It is a title that best reflects the coverage. No story refers to this as the "Plotkin Ring" or the "Pajcin Ring", which is why I think those titles would be missing the mark. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[36mAndyTheGrump: Not having a 'nifty name' is no reason to skew an article, and the sources cited in the article clearly mention other people. I ask again, what is the topic? rebuttal_labels:: DH2: Attempted derailing/off-topic
[34mTheRedPenOfDoom: we can decide what the subject is. it has been: "Eugene Plotkin, a man involved in one of the largest insider trading schemes that the media has focused much coverage on." rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mAndyTheGrump: Nope. If the insider dealing scheme is notable, we cover it. If it isn't, there is no justification for a biography of one of those involved. 'We' do not misrepresent articles about individuals involvement in crimes as biographies. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mFactchecker25: I agree with AndyTheGump. It is particularly egregious in this case, when so much of the conspiracy involves Pajcin, Pajcin's aunt, Pajcin's high school friend, and Pajcin's girlfriend. Plotkin is not notable outside of the scheme. The question is whether the scheme is notable. If the consensus is that it is, then the name and the content of the article should reflect the topic. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mTheRedPenOfDoom: the fact that we are talking about people involved in "the largest insider trading scheme" means that we are obviously talking about something that is notable and that will at the minimum result in Eugene Plotkin being a redirect to whatever the final subject is determined to be. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mAndyTheGrump: Can I take it from that reply that you agree the article should be about the insider trading scheme rather than Plotkin? rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mFactchecker25: I believe that "largest insider trading scheme" is not an accurate description of this scheme at all. The scheme netted less than $7 million, which means it pales in comparison to schemes such as Galleon, Bernie Madoff, Michael Milken, SAC Capital, and others which are 10 to 20 times the amount. The only notable things about this scheme, aside from the media coverage, seem to be the usage of multiple sources (Business Week, Merrill Lynch, Grand Jury) - although the Galleon case involved even more sources - and a collection of a fairly motley group of conspirators. rebuttal_labels:: 
[36mAndyTheGrump: It is 'media coverage', or rather "significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject" that determines notability, as far as Wikipedia is concerned. rebuttal_labels:: 
[34mTheRedPenOfDoom: i agree that the community might come to the consensus that it is the scheme and not the individual that is notable, but i dont think that consensus has been reached yet. Plotkin has had specific features written about him and sources specifically singly identify him and no other individual names when talking about the event. while i have only seen one  that talks about any of the others without Plotkin. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[36mAndyTheGrump: It simply makes no sense to suggest that a biography Plotkin can meet Wikipedia guidelines solely on the basis of being one of several participants in a non-notable insider trading scheme. If the scheme ''was'' notable, we must have an article on it before even contemplating having an article on Plotkin. If it ''wasn't'', this article must be deleted per WP:BLP1E policy. There really aren't any other policy-complying options. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mSmallbones: The 26 refs look pretty solid, perhaps overwieghted to the New York Times, with a Washington Post, and Boston Globe, and several good international papers.  Many of the rest are the usual sprinkling of AP, local sources for local details (Harvard Crimson).  The 2 new ones can be linked to the source.  I checked back to the first "finished version" Jan 15, 2008, which still stands up as a marvelously written article (if I do say so myself) which reflects the sources at the time, which was when Plotkin was being sentenced and Pajcin being release for cooperating.  Back then I missed the NTY 2006 article which shows the story in a more rounded out way.  There likely were tons more stories that are now behind archive paywalls, but a google search on "Eugene Plotkin" gives 186,000 results, "David Pajcin" gives less than half that  at 69,000.  "Stanislav Shpigelman" only 2,720.  I conclude that the way the article is written now is consistent with the coverage in the media.  () rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[36mAndyTheGrump: Yes - there are quite sufficient sources to justify an article on the insider trading scheme - can you explain why you are opposed to Wikipedia having one? rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mFactchecker25: As pointed out elsewhere, the number of Google hits on "Eugene Plotkin" only means that "Eugene Plotkin" is a far more common name than either "David Pajcin" or "Stanislav Shpigelman". A majority of those hits do not refer to THIS Eugene Plotkin, so they are irrelevant. All the trades were in Pajcin's account, Pajcin's aunt's account, Pajcin's girlfriend accounts, and various Croatians' accounts. The key trades came from Reebok, which was info provided by Shpigelman. Plotkin introduced Pajcin and Shpigelman, but then it was the Pajcin/Shpigelman nexus that drove this to the big payday. The coverage makes that clear. In any event, I think it has been well established here and I agree with AndyTheGrump that an article on the case should not masquerade as a BLP of Plotkin (or any of the other co-conspirators, for that matter). rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mSmallbones: You say "The coverage makes that clear." Actually, no.  It appears that there is a lot of interpretation going on here, or stuff that I haven't seen in the sources.  In any case, please provide refs.  () rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mFactchecker25: The sources could not be more clear. The New York Times reported  that Reebok represented $6 million of the case, of which $2.5 million was in Pajcin's aunt's account, and that Pajcin was the leader. The New York Times also reported  that the $6 million was primarily distributed among the accounts of Pajcin's aunt (Anticevic), Pajcin's girlfriend (Vujovic), and various Croatians (Sormaz, Lopandic, Borac) living in Croatia and Germany. No surprise, as Pajcin is Croatian. The Boston Globe confirmed  that Pajcin is an ex-broker who was trading through his own accounts and a network of personal connections in Croatia, Germany and Austria. The Age confirmed  that Pajcin is a former stockbroker and that the FBI stated that Pajcin bought and sold the stocks. USA Today reported  that it was the Reebok trades in Pajcin's aunt's account that tipped off the investigation and that Vujovic was an exotic dancer who was Pajcin's girlfriend. With regard to Shpigelman, the Boston Globe reported  that Shpigelman leaked information about Reebok (largest part of the case) and that the government said he did it "out of greed". The New York Post reported  that Shpigelman was introduced to Pajcin in late 2004 and elsewhere it was reported that Pajcin was the one who paid Shpigelman. A number of these sources refer to it as the Reebok Insider Trading Case or similar. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
[32mSmallbones: Read the sources you provided: the 2005 and 2006 sources (before Plotkin was arrested) don't mention Plotkin, but the others (2007 sources) say that Plotkin was trading on the info and spreading the information to others.  () rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mFactchecker25: I have read the sources in depth. I suggest you finally do the same. Plotkin was involved in the case. He introduced Shpigelman to Pajcin and was involved in recruiting the Business Week plant workers. However, Pajcin was clearly the central figure as the majority of the tippees were his Croatian family members or friends and the key accounts were traded in and controlled by him. The investigation started with him and his aunt and he was the only one to violate his sentence and flee the country. Within the case, the most valuable information was provided by Shpigelman. Plotkin received a lot of media attention in 2006 because he was arrested at that time and Pajcin was already cooperating, so the government's press releases (and the media, by extension) focused on Plotkin. However, if you look at the media coverage '''as a whole''', meaning from August 2005 until the present, the case and the underlying story line become far more clear. I realize that when you wrote the original Wikipedia article, you missed the 2005 coverage and did not go beyond the 2006 coverage. But that is certainly no reason to fight against the inclusion of that information and the revision of the article into one that deals with the topic in a more objective and even-handed manner. rebuttal_labels:: DH6: Refutation
