[31mPBS: I have removed the section  Noncombatant because "noncombatant" means those who are in a war zone but are not combatants. The majority of those events listed in this section were not for deaths related to war. Those that were are already listed in the section "Wars and armed conflicts". If someone wants to create two columns under "Wars and armed conflicts". One for '''combatants''' and the other for '''non-combatants'', then all well and good. But the current division into two lists make no sense when the totals entries differ and overlap. rebuttal_labels::

[31mPBS: this edit by an IP address reintroduced the noncombatants section without a comment in the history or on this talk page. I am deleting the section again for the same reasons as given above. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mGatoclass: Dictionary definitions of "noncombatant" differ - webster's just defines it as "one who does not engage in combat". Seems an appropriate enough title to me. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mPBS: non combatant explains what a non combatant is. It has a specific meaning under international law. There are two obvious examples in the list but the rest are not non-combatant killings. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[32mGatoclass: Who says we have to use the definition given by the Geneva Conventions? Seems to me we are perfectly entitled to employ the term in its common, dictionary sense. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mPBS: Oxford English Dictionary "non-combatant, n. and adj."
A. n.    A person who is not a combatant, as a civilian during a war; spec. a member of the armed services whose duties do not include active fighting, as a surgeon, purser, or chaplain, etc. Also in extended use.
B. adj.    Not involved in fighting; of, belonging to, or characteristic of a non-combatant.
It seems that The dictionary definition is the same as that of International law. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[32mGatoclass: Okay, well how about we call it "Civilians" or "Civilians and non-combatants" instead? rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mPBS: Gatoclass, I really don't understand your motives over this article, the title is List of wars and disasters by death toll what exactly is this section meant to cover because it is not at all clear at the moment?
If it was a list of wars by non-combatant deaths then that would be a coherent title. The trouble would be that in most wars although fairly reliable numbers are kept on military casualties they are not kept on civilians. The British numbers for civilian casualties in World War II are the exception not the rule (even the Germans who are know for keeping accurate records do not have them for World War II). One of the problems is that if one is working with raw population statistics (if they are available) it is necessary to extrapolate the number of dead over and above those that would have died within a population if no war had taken place. The means that most estimates are very rough and ready and open to misinterpretation, so any list of civilian war dead is likely to have such ranges as to be next to useless as a meaningful list.
It seems to me better to have just one "Wars and armed conflicts" with four columns to cover max and min for combatants and non-combatants and junk this section unless you can suggest what this section is meant to be listing so that a NPOV list can be created. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mGatoclass: This is not a page about "wars and armed conflicts", it's a page about large death tolls brought about by human agency, and as such is a complement to the page about large death tolls from natural disasters. Wars are clearly not the only method by which human beings have inflicted mass death on populations, that is why we have a number of sections to cover the different areas. I'm fine with tweaking section headers and/or section summaries where necessary, but I see no reason whatever for deleting entire sections, almost all the entries here list very well documented mass deaths inflicted by human beings, the issue of how best to label or organize them does not detract from their relevance to the overall topic. rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mPBS: You still have not suggested what this section is meant to be listing. That is needed if it is not to be a indiscriminate list. rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mGatoclass: I've just given you a couple of explanations and alternatives, how can you say I've made no suggestions? rebuttal_labels:: DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument
[32mGatoclass: The section basically lists significant death tolls inflicted on civilian populations. That seems pretty straightforward to me. I've already suggested that we rename the section either "Civilian death tolls" or "Civilian and non-combatant death tolls" but you haven't responded to those suggestions. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mPBS: I thought we had already set aside armed conflict as a category, so they can not be civilian death tolls (OED "A non-military man or official.") rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mPBS: , rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mGatoclass: Sorry, I don't follow, what do you mean by "we had already set aside armed conflict as a category"? rebuttal_labels:: 
[31mPBS: We already have a section for armed conflict and most of the rat-bag of entries here have little to do with armed conflict (those that do would be better served in the war section which includes both combatant and non-combatant totals). rebuttal_labels:: 
[32mGatoclass: Well if they have "little to do with armed conflict", all the more reason to have them in this section! That's what it's for - civilian death tolls exclusive of collateral damage from battle. rebuttal_labels:: DH5: Counterargument
[31mPBS: Civilians killed in battle are still civilians (although they may or may not be non-combatants). I am removing this section again as there has been no progress to defining what it is and the vast majority of entries have nothing to do with war. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[34mPropatriamori: This articles title is `List of war and "disaters" by death tolls`,so I think there is no problem even that this section nothhing connection to war.
If you don`t like this sections name `Non-combattant` changing sections name is better than delete it. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mPBS: A list must have some form of structure that defines it. This particular section does not have any form of definition it is just a collection of facts.  For example what are the criteria links the slave trade, the deths of Leopold's congo and the Irish Potato Famine, and  228 Incident, it certainly isn't non-combattant deaths. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
[31mPBS: Removed section now titled Civilian as many of the entries are not "campaigns"  and  "civilians or noncombatants" implies war, yet many of the entries have nothing to do with war.  This particular section does not have any form of definition it is just a collection of facts.  For example what are the criteria links the slave trade, the deths of Leopold's congo and the Irish Potato Famine, and  228 Incident, it certainly isn't non-combattant deaths. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Repeated argument
[31mPBS: The new title is not much better than the old one because under such a definition any killing of more than three people could be described as a mass killing and be included in the list. Mass killings are not necessarily either war or a disaster. rebuttal_labels:: DH4: Stating your stance
