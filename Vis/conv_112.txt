{'text': 'I changed this to better reflect the article itself - the previous wording showed a misunderstanding of its meaning (either that or perhaps it hadn\'t been thoroughly read). Either way, it\'s an analysis of support for UKIP, more than the party\'s strategy. It says some policies are similar to those of the BNP, but doesn\'t equate them and makes the distinction between UKIP and the "extreme right" BNP (and that comparison forms a much smaller part of the report than the voting analysis). The sample size of the report (a population extrapolation of the YouGov online panel before the last European elections) doesn\'t damage the credibility of the research itself, but does mean that it can be seen in the context of "revealing" something, rather "suggesting" it, similar to the way opinion polls etc "suggest" something, rather than reveal it.

{'text': 'The section now reads "...claiming significant xenophobic and increasing Islamophobic elements in UKIP\'s strategy." I note this wasn\'t the edit made by , but this has now gone from one extreme to another. Arguing the report \'claims\' something implies it isn\'t properly researched - it is. But saying the report \'reveals\' something is a naive interpretation of data gathered through opinion polls. That is not to deny them any credibility, but anything gathered through them needs to be set in the context of what they are; an extrapolation of the thoughts of a small sample of the population, onto the population at large. You would never hear references to polls "revealing" most of a country wants a change in government, for example. they would "suggest it", or words to that effect.

{'text': 'I agree those words would be better (even though the authors themselves describe their research as "suggesting" its conclusions). Now to the representation of the report - the description in the article suggests the report is primarily about UKIP\'s strategy - when in fact it\'s nearly all an analysis of UKIP\'s voters, far far less about the strategy, and indeed where strategy is mentioned, it\'s most often cited from other research. This includes the line at the end about the BNP - which, when read in full, says "As John and Margetts (2009: 501; also Borisyuk et al. 2007) observe, the BNP and UKIP adopt similar discourses on issues of immigration and national identity" - this is not original research. It\'d be far better to cite John and Margetts (2009: 501; also Borisyuk et al. 2007) here than to give others credit for their work. The main problem with the BNP line from my point of view is that it seems a strange line to pick out of the report, as most of it differentiates the two parties by describing the BNP as "far right". Perhaps a better line to use might be "UKIP’s credentials as a legitimate party of right-wing protest over Europe may make it a ‘polite alternative’ for voters angry about rising immigration levels or elite corruption but who are repelled by the stigmatized image of the more extreme BNP". Or the abstract could be used - "UKIP is well positioned to recruit a broader and more enduring base of support than the BNP and become a significant vehicle of xenophobia and, more specifically, Islamophobia in modern Britain." I am not an apologist for UKIP and am not making these suggestions for political reasons - they represent the content of the report much better than to suggest it is an analysis of the party\'s strategy, rather than an analysis of its supporters.', 'username': 'Pjbeef', 'rebuttal_labels': [], 'coordination_labels': ['Coordinating edits']}
